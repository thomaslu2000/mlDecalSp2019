Very easy to set-up, although two things annoy me.(1) That I need to purchase a proprietary Componant-to-HDMI cable from SlingMedia to get HD routed through this box. Its not an expensive cable, as HD cables go, but if I can't technically route an HDMI source, why fit the Sling with an HDMI connector? Maybe we're talking space-contraints here, since the Pro is already a bit larger than the other SlingBoxes and HDMI takes up less space than componants. Still, most people with similar set-ups will have componant cables lying around to integrate this thing into their set-up. The Componant-to-HDMI cable should really have been included with the Pro.(2) No 802.11a\\b\\g\\n option. Yes, you can go get your own 802.11-to-Ethernet bridge. Or you can use the (expensive) powerline networking option. Frankly, I'd much rather see a larger SlingBox with a couple extra cubic inches in the box to cram in an 802.11 chipset and an antenna hanging out the back. But I guess that would just increase the headache on SlingMedia's end, from a technical support standpoint.That said, I still love this unit. The MAC OS X client works like a charm, despite being in Beta. On a Core Duo MacBook Pro, the OS X client is quicker than the WinXP client running on similar Core Duo Dell hardware (E1705). Very nice. Being able to customize the button interface and swap interfaces between Mac and PC (to suit what cable channels you commonly watch) is a nice touch as well.Lacking any Pocket PC hardware, I can't tell you how well the handheld client runs (are you listening Sling? My Blackberry feels left out!) although the friend that recommended this product to me has connected to my Sling over the internet with his handheld HP.I'm done here.

And forget about slideshows!4. If your TV is NTSC, then you have to Scroll through the Player's menus etc. to change it over to PAL for any PAL movies!5. It has trouble with large DivX files. Enough to make it unusable. If you need to fast-forward through a large part of the movie, forget it - it totally freezes up!6. Worst but not least, the whole time, it kept making this insane, high pitch noise that sounded like an army of dog whistles in you ear, only more grating. It kept making the noise, then it would stop and start again after about 10 seconds and go for a long time. I knew this noise would never fly with ANY of my friends. I couldn't take it and I have bad hearing and am a very tolerant person..lol!This is what I found in about 1 hour of testing, and I wasn't trying to test it at all! I just wanted to watch ANYTHING and it just so happened  that the PET wasn't able to make that happen. Imagine what you would find out if you REALLY tested it? I didn't. I sent it back.I have seen a better DivX player in a modded Xbox EASY! and MUCH cheaper too. All the problems I just discussed are NO PROBLEM on a modded Xbox. And that came out in 2001! The DivX player industry right now is basically non-existent.  It is too experimental for real people to actually use it.Bottom line: The only people who like this unit are rich, yuppie, loaded guys who just want every gadget and don't plan on REALLY using it. ..or, they just got ripped off really bad on a portable DVD player for just playing storebought DVDs"}, {"title": "Picture Perfect", "review_text": "I was blown away by the picture on the Phillips PET824 portable DVD player. The LCD screen is \"liquid\" crystal clear. You lose a little definition as you move side to side (as with most LCD type screens) which only comes into play if you're trying to share the screen in really close quarters (like if three of you are trying to watch in 3 side-by-side coach fare airline seats). But if the PET824 is primarily for personal use you'll love the picture.The sound is fair without headphones, but I don't think that the idea was to use PET824 without them. Sound is fabulous with a good pair of headphones; your iPod headphones will do just fine (and if you don't have a good pair you'll need to buy one because the PET824 doesn't come with any).The battery is a bit bulky. You'd think that with today's technology they'd be able to slim it down, but you can't complain about the 6 hours of life you get with it after a full charge. Some portable DVD players give you only 2 hours of life and that just barely gets you through a single movie. The PET824 is good for 2 full length features before charging and that's awesome for long trips where you can't use the DC adapter or car adapter.The battery fully charges in apx 4 hours. And don't leave the battery attached after shutting down so as to preserve the charge.The car adapter works great and has a nice long cord. So no need for the battery on car trips.The PET824 fits in my small briefcase, and it's relatively light. Amazon sells cases for the PET824 that mount on the back of the driver or passenger seats. The one I got also mounts in between the driver and passenger seats. I'd highly recommend a case for your player. I went with the Case Logic Koskin DVD Player Case.The biggest complaint I have about the PET824 is that the anti-slide pads on the bottom of the player are worthless. The player slides all over the place on a hard surface, and that won't do at all on an airline fold down tray. I put some good sticky anti-slide pads on my PET824 (available at any hardware store for less than a dollar).Also the remote's a bit busy for kids, but my kids mastered it pretty quickly. For whatever reason the remote includes a bunch of useless number keys (0 - 9) that take up space that could have been used to make the primary function keys bigger. As is, the remote is useless in a dark car.Finally, the DivX thing is a bit of a mystery to me. I've not tried it out yet, and I'm not clear as to whether or not you can burn DivX movies with just the DivX software or if you need a DVD burner on your home computer system in order to burn and be able to play downloaded DivX video on your Phillips PET824 portable (or DivX compatible home DVD player for that matter). I checked some DivX sites and they're all pretty (deliberately???) ambiguous on how exactly it works with burning a DivX DVD. And all the DivX movie sharing and downloading sites seem to want your email address before they'll even let you see what kind of movies are even available. So I'd welcome a review that is clear and concise on the matter.All in all....The PET824 was a very satisfying purchase for me. I'm glad it's the one that I chose."}, {"title": "AWESOME!!

Been running it for 7 hours already (2 hours in stand-by mode), and the battery is still alive! I even had to make sure that I haven't plugged in the power supply by mistake. And no, to my great surprise, it is on the battery!Quite honestly, I had hard time believing other reviewers who had claimed the same thing, but I do now, it is true.Also, you can make it region free.

Sometimes you need to aim it directly at the player. Wish they designed the remote better. But that is the only drawback which does not really bother me much. Considering other great features (DIVX/XVID playback with QPEL and GMC support - yes, it does that!)and awesome video/audio quality (did I mention 2 headphones inputs???), it is very well worth every dollar.

Now working, the player is exceptional, the screen fairly crisp (not to mention well sized) the AV in/out very handy, and the aesthetics pleasing.The player has also taken every type of DivX file I can throw at it, including XviD among the various codecs.However, when starting the unit up, it makes a good deal of noise that dulls to a still noticeable hum during playback. Also, viewable file names are limited to 10 characters or so, making some recognition difficult.

You can practically 'feel' the really deep rumbling sounds from movies like 'War of the World.'  The battery life also shocked and pleased me.  I wanted to see if it would actually last the 6 hours advertised, so I watched one movie, put in another movie and fell asleep for 4-5 hours.

Anyways, being in the electronics industry, I had two thoughts before I wanted to plunk down this much money for cables:1. I'll make my own cables and save money, or2. I'll buy cheaper cables, say Magnavox, Philips, Radio shack and save money.I researched making my own cables and realized the following: Monster connectors are better than most - not all gold-plated connectors are equal in physical quality and electrical connecting quality. How they actually grip your equipment is important. Next, cable is easily available, but most of it is rather rigid. Monster cables are soft and bendable, and that's important. A cable must maintain a parameter called \"impedance\" as it is distorted. Besides, stiff cables are tough to run and pull on your equipment. Finally, I needed a high quality crimping tool to attach the RCA connectors to the cable. A really good crimper starts at $80. So, I gave up on this idea.2. I'll buy less expensive cables: well, not all connectors or cables are created equal, as I mentioned above. You buy quality cables to preserve that parameter I mentioned, \"impedance\", and to reduce interference. This doesn't happen with cheap cables. As I mentioned, not all gold-plated connectors are equal, nor do they connect with the same \"interference limiting\" capabilites. Next, Monster will tell you, at their website, which cables are double-shielded: a braided shield over a foil shield-this is what REALLY keeps out the interference. Finally, not all shielded cables are equal, because some have a coverage of 50% thru 95%, and Monster tells you what you're getting. Also, some shields are aluminum and some are copper..I've picked up many a set of cheaper name brand cables, and none of these parameters were spelled out.So, if you have spent some decent money for your system, or you might be transferring a collection of VHS tapes to DVDs, or you might be archiving personally owned DVDs, or you might one day own great equipment, then you need good cables. Will they make everything that much better? I can't tell you without running tests and doing some measurements, but they did work better for me, and double-shielding with special gripping gold-plated connectors will be better.Finally, I saw where someone pointed out that RCA connectors were NOT the best way to transfer video or component signals, and they are right. So, knowing that, wouldn't you want the best cables possible? Also, DON'T buy a lower model of Monster cables, or get composite instead of component cables. Component cables yield the top performance, followed by S-Video cables, followed by Composite cables. Spend the money now and you'll already own the best cables without spending your hard earned money, AGAIN, to \"move up\""}, {"title": "As with anything, only buy if you NEED them!", "review_text": "These are cables are great if you have a system that might actually take advantage of them.  I have a 50' Sony LCD Projection and the Sony Dav-FR8 Dream System, if I did not own a television that had a native 720p format or equivalant and a decent progressive scan DVD, why would I buy a 50$ cable to connect them.When you get into mid to higher end components, your system becomes only as good as its weakest element, for me probaly my dvd player in my HTIB.  In my case, I did notice a difference once I upgraded, I now know that I am recieving the best possiable picture from my DVD, but I am a into this sort of thing, for most it may all look the same.In short these are not nessecary for 90% of home theaters, but if you spent $3000+ on your tv, I would say why not spring for them, otherwise you are not taking full advantage of your investment.

The drives are well designed, and dependable. Many of the product reviews I have read on Amazon contradict my experience.I think it is important to note that any hard drive, no matter the brand name, is in danger of failure. External hard drive failure is to be anticipated in my profession (video editor, artist, teacher). Almost any professional working with video will tell you to buy 2 hard drives, one to  work on and the second to back up the first. Another strategy is to intermittently back up your data on DVDs, but this approach is time consuming and imperfect.I would also like to add that one of the most common causes for external hard drive failure is improper shut down. Every time your hard drive is disconnected improperly from your computer you risk failure. I teach video editing to undergraduate students at Hunter College. I have observed that teaching the students how to properly disconnect their external drives from the computers almost eliminates drive failure. Out of my class of 9 students last semester (the majority using Lacie hard drives) there was not a single problem.External Drive Shut Down Instructions (Macintosh):1) Eject your external drive by throwing the disk icon in the trash or using another method (see Mac Help \"Ejecting a disk, server volume, CD or DVD disk, or other devices\").2) Once the disk icon has disappeared from your desktop, turn off your hard drive (pressing the drives power button or flipping its switch to the off position).3) Once the drive is turned off, disconnect the data cable connecting the drive to the computer.4) Finally, unplug power supply from power source.I have known multiple people who have lost irreplaceable data to hard drive failure, regardless of brand name. Whether Seagate, IOGear, Maxtor or Lacie there is a chance of failure no matter what precautions one takes. My experience has been that Lacie D2 drives are dependable and trouble free when used properly"}, {"title": "Great product", "review_text": "I cant say how long this unit will last but I installed mine today on a win xp system and the install was totally without problem.

About the only time you'll probably hear any noise at all from it is when it's seeking data but even then, the the noise is negligible. Also very conveinient is the large glowing  blue power button (thankfully located on the FRONT of the HD, not in the rear like some including the EZQUEST  hard drives) which blinks rapidly when searching the hard drive for content and glows continuously when the hard drive is not in use.

If you use this as a solitary storage device for data you will be sorry. I am paying the price for my trust in what used to be a reputable brand.The LaCie d2 \"Big Disk\" I bought about a year and a half ago (which was advertised as a 320GB  drive) IS ACTUALLY TWO DRIVES! You heard me correctly. Nowhere on the box will you find this information spelled out, but inside the enclosure is two 160GB drives and a controller card that makes the two drives appear as one on your computer's desktop. Not only that, THEY AREN'T MADE BY LaCIE, THEY ARE MAXTOR DRIVES! That is correct, inside the LaCie enclosure is two Maxtor drives. (Maybe this is what is implied by the brand name \"d2\")The reason I feel so cheated by this fact is because the LaCie failed on me, and only one of those drives contains the directory. That means that there are thousands of files that I can't open because some of their data (or the directory information about the missing data) is on the other drive, and since the drive(s) failed, they will not work together anymore in the same enclosure. I had to take the LaCie to a repair place that had to remove both drives from the enclosure and work on them separetely since they no longer work in tandem (that's when I discovered there was two Maxtor drives inside). It took them many hours, and cold temperatures had to be applied to get data off of the drive; I got back probably two thirds of the data that was most important to me, but it cost me almost $2000 just to have this done and it was only on one of the drives. I had to forgo extracting info from the other drive for now because I ran out of money.I should feel lucky to have as much data back as I do, because many people don't get that much back, and some don't get any back. People who have the money (CEOs, celebs, etc.) can send their drive to Drive Savers and possibly get all their data back, but it can cost tens of thousands of dollars easily. I didn't have that option.I have learned two hard lessons for the future: 1) I'll be buying more SINGLE hard drives so they can act as failsafe drives for each other (possibly RAID striping drives in the future), and 2) I will never buy a LaCie product again. This is the most poorly-designed piece of crap I have ever trusted my data to, and it makes you MORE likely to lose your data, not less. When your data and/or directory info is scattered over two devices, and one of them fails (or they both fail to work together), you are hosed. Your data is screwed.Do yourself a favor and get a Seagate drive, and several of them.

While there were some 22 and 23 inch widescreen monitors that matched the 215TW's PQ, they were priced hundreds of dollars more.  In the $500 and under bracket, the 215TW was hands-down the best PQ we saw.I think it is the 1000:1 contrast ratio that makes the difference, but the 215TW just had a far superior picture compared to other Samsungs, and to ViewSonics, Gateways, and anything else on the shelf.  All had the same pictures displayed and driven by the same PC, so the playing field was level and the 215TW stood way out.After stumbling onto an unadvertised sale on this monitor, we quickly purchased it.  We hooked it up to our Power Mac G4 MDD with Radeon 9600 video card.  While the instructions show the hook up for Macs to be only analog, ignore that.  Our 215TW is working fine via a DVI connection, and the PQ is really stunning with our Mac set up.Samsung doesn't provide the accompanying software in the Mac OS, but that is not much of a problem.  Only the MagicTune software is unavailable for Macs with this Samsung monitor as the MagicBright function is built into the monitor setup buttons.  That isn't true for the smaller and cheaper Samsungs.We are running the 215TW at a resolution of 1680 x 1050 @ 60 Hz, which is the unit's maximum.  It is more than adequate for watching QuickTime movie trailers in HD and allows for really sharp text.  Our 215TW replaced a 19\" ViewSonic PF790 professional series CRT, aperture grille monitor.  The increased text clarity and reduced eye strain with the 215TW is a welcome surprise, and the color saturation and distinction is gorgeous.Viewing angle with the 215TW is as good or better than any of its competition.  Response time is more than adequate as we haven't detected any ghosting with fast moving video.  Movie DVDs look fabulous on this monitor.  Watching Pirates of the Caribbean on this monitor makes it look like near HD quality.Finally, the adjustable, rotating, and flipping stand is really nice.  Too bad so many LCD monitors are stuck with basically non-adjustable stands.No dead pixels on the unit we purchased and no problems with anything after two weeks of ownership and use.  Build quality appears good, and Samsung included both a VGA and a DVI cable with the monitor.  Nice!We highly recommend this monitor for anyone looking for a widescreen LCD computer monitor in this size range and to any Mac users looking for a highly compatible widescreen LCD monitor"}, {"title": "Could this be a perfect monitor?", "review_text": "This is written from someone who has had this monitor for 5 months now.To begin, I wasn't sure if I would like buying a high end monitor with a built in speaker. For me it works out perfectly. The sounds quality in the speaker is juse like every other speaker built into a monitor....subpar. However, it is not an eye soar to look at and the headphone jack is right in the front for easy access. The sound output into headphones is perfect. I have a ps2 set up to my monitor and with the built in speaker I can plug in my headphones and get sound from the ps2 without having to change any cords or settings.One thing I really love is the swivel base design that Samsung uses on this series of monitors. If you want to watch anything from a different location in the room the swivel base can be moved easily in any direction. In fact, the monitor's range of motion in with tilt, swivel and hertical cannot be beaten by any other monitor and can only be matched.No reason to talk about the image quality of this monitor. It is top notch and comes with a highly configurable PIP.One that might be a negative to some people is the lack of USB ports that are often built into high end monitors like this. My computer has eight USB ports to begin with and two in the keyboard so the last thing I need are more ports.This monitor also comes with a DVI cord.

There is a cover over the wheel to protect that (and it doesn't affect the control over the wheel), and the screen protector is even thicker. its comfortable to hold, and it has a nice cover for the plug on the bottom, I feel safe knowing that my Ipod won't get hurt inside it. The only thing is that the case can make a little bit of crud on your Ipod, but that can be wiped off right after you take it out of the case.

I tried four different cases, both hard plastic and silicone variants, and the iskin case comes the closest, protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.The case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone. The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen. In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seams on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection. Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don't have to worry about it scratching.The case even has a flap that covers the dock connector, preventing dust from entering, yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.The most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel, but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling. Actually, I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel.The only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--I would not trust it at all, so I took it off. It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use, and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well, but as I said above, I have yet to find a perfect ipod case. Like most silicone cases, this one does also attract lint in your pockets, etc., but it is not as bad as other cases.Unfortunately, even though this is a great case, it is not readily available. I couldn't find it in any store, and Amazon only sells it through Marketplace sellers. I ordered from Applelinks, and they delivered it to me in four days. Whatever you do, don't order from the iSkin company directly. I have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases.

Paid $63.71 for product and shipping. It was shipped out a few days later, and I received my order within a week.I had read that this product would not support newer iPod Nanos. Having just purchased a new Nano last month, I believed I would need an adapter once the product arrived. Fortunately, this is not true. This product, the TuneBase FM for iPod Nano did support my new iPod Nano with silver backing. I believe those who said this product is not compatible were referring to the TuneBase FM that is designed for the full-size iPod and is said to support all existing iPods. Either that, or Belkin revised the product. The Belkin TuneBase FM for iPod Nano fit my new 4GB Nano perfectly.As for reception, there is a small amount of static in the background, but this is minimal. I mean really, it's an FM transmission, so I didn't expect it to be as clear as a direct feed. I live in Burbank, CA, and have had no problems listening to my iPod while driving all over the Los Angeles City region. I was a little worried, as another reviewer said reception was bad in the Los Angeles area. Once again, I found this to not be true in my case.Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase. It took me under five minutes to install it in my ride. I plugged in my iPod, tuned my stereo receiver to the channel shown on my iPod's screen, and in less than a minute was listening to my favorite tunes.I guess we'll have to see how the product holds up over the long haul.

The only drawback is that I do notice some static when travelling near heavy powerlines or when I'm using my cellphone.

Cars with FM antennas nearer the cigarette lighter will probably help the TuneBase break through easier.There is a signal boost feature that I have not yet tried.If you carry your Nano around in any sort of silicone or other hugging type case, you will have to slide it up to fit the nano into the tunebase.

And that doesn't help much, but if you are a Windows user (including XP; that was apparently a problem with older SB Live! cards) who uses the common Intel chipset and would like better sound without spending a lot of money, I would recommend this.Even basic sounds like the click you hear when you click your mouse with Windows sound better. I noticed much better stereo separation, for example. A faster sampling rate, up to 96 KHz, also helps a lot. Various 3D effects are available, including reverb, EQ, sound cleanup and other enhancements, are also available. Surround Sound is supported, up to 7.1.I've read other reviews on SoundBlaster products saying the tech support is bad. I haven't had to call them yet (I found installation was pretty easy, but I'm fairly experienced with installing hardware and software), so hopefully you won't have any problems.Also, if you plan on using MIDI - and being a songwriter/composer, I do this a lot - I recommend shopping around for a better soundfont. The four-megabyte soundfont file doesn't cut it for me, though it does sound a little better than the GM.DLS used by DirectMusic, and it supports the Roland GS extensions to General MIDI. If you use a very large soundfont (they can run up to 128 MB and possibly even more), you will need a lot of memory: 256 MB RAM at the very least, and a fast microprocessor is a must as well, especially if you use a MIDI controller to your computer, in case you want to make your PC double as a synthesizer.This product isn't perfect, and doesn't have all the features of Audigy or other higher-end soundcards, but it delivers what it promises"}, {"title": "Only a Windows card", "review_text": "The SB Live 24bit is a Windows only sound card.

The sound is wonderful and they allow me to keep the volume down on my ipod (with the ipod earphones, my volume was at the halfway mark most of the time, but with these earphones, the volume is hardly showing on the meter). The earphones do provide some sound isolation; if you are looking for something that completely blocks out noise, these probably aren't for you. However, I wanted something that could drown out most noise; now I can walk down the street and hear my music even if a bus or truck is rumbling by, and I can actually hear my music while on a bus.

I own about a dozen other headphones which are considered by many to be among the best. I even own Ultimate Ears UE-10 custom in ear monitors (IEM's).I recently heard the super.fi 3 Studio at a local hi-fi meet. Coming from rather high end sources I wasn't expecting much from the super.fi 3 Studio since the source was only an iPod with lossless files. I doubted the super.fi 3 Studio could even come close to the Shure E3c. I couldn't be any further from the truth. Not only did the super.fi 3 Studio blow away the more expensive Shure E3c, it blew away many other in ear monitors which I heard that day. What is even more impressive is that the price is extremely affordable.If that isn't enough, this little IEM can handle sound like few others can. It sounds great with almost everything you can throw at it, classical, hip-hop, rock, pop, electronica, etc. The only area where I find this little IEM lacking is clarity and detail but that is only because I am used to the UE-10. However, keep in mind that the UE-10 is a $1,000.00 IEM.Given the price and considering the high quality sound output this thing has, it is a must have for anyone looking for a hi-fi alternative to their horrible sounding iBuds.

Since this one seemed to have the basics (which is what I needed) and it was relatively inexpensive, it won my bid.Overall I'd say this is a worthwhile purchase.  My guess is that I simply had/have a bad experience.In short, there's a little fuse inside the device that blew the first time I used it.  (It worked fine for about 10 minutes then died.)  After replacing the fuse (they're like 5/$2 at Radio Shack), everything works fine again.The only other complaint, which may not really be the transmitter's fault, is that the transmitter doesn't actually fit well into the cigarette lighter in either of my vehicles (1993 Mercury Topaz and 2002 Toyota Camry).  It seems to fit fine in friends' cars.  The workaround is to unscrew the top and then shove it in.  You just need to keep the two small pieces - one plastic, one metal - somewhere for safe keeping until you're done.  The transmitter will feel a little loose this way, but it works fine.  Sadly, with the top on (as designed), it just doesn't work.Beyond that, this little device sounds just fine, is very handy to have and was worth the $20 or so I paid for it.  However, if I knew what I knew now I may have spent another $10-$20 for a device with less hassle.  By reading the other reviews, however, I think my situation is unique.

I can see how other reviewers of other units would be displeased if they had, say, four to choose from: some of the channels in my town (fairly big metropolitan radio market) are fuzzy, whiny, etc. However, there are two that work GREAT for me, and surely you will find one or two that are gems for you.The pictures on Amazon seem to omit the black coiled cable coming out the edge of the silver part of the unit, but it is sweet: good quality, \"heavier duty\" coated coiled wire. Will not get kinked up or tangled. The whole unit from tip to tip is solid and fairly well made for consumer electronics.To hook my T-Mobile SDA Music Smartphone to this unit, I had to go get a 1/16\" to 1/32\" adapter from Radio Shack and it worked great! Even with the microphone lead missing, there is no buzz or hum resulting from the adapter to this unit.On my best channel, I can hear a slight whine if I turn it way up. And I mean to the point where it would blast me if the music was playing.The unit simply sounds great. Bass is deep and rich, treble is clear and pleasant, on par with standard, clear reception from a local radio station.Two big features to be aware of:The silver part swivels all the way to the side of the cigarette lighter adapter, and all the way back around flat against the top of the flat black part. That is nice for getting it in just the right spot for your car's particular shape.Secondly (!) the black, flat part of the cigarette lighter piece is a cap that pops off, so you can stick another cigarette lighter adapter in there! I put my radar detector in there and it works great, no interference whatsoever.I use this thing to listen to podcasts from my phone, which I have put a 1GB memory card in to store the shows. Every day to work and back, I have innovative, exciting and (especially) non-boring programming to listen to. Very little need for repetitious, ad-laden \"regular\" radio now.I like to listen to old-time radio podcasts, The Entertainment Beat with Frances Gumm (hilarious), the Rare African Grooves podcast and the Bluegrass Preservation Society Radio Program with Ewell Ferguson. Great stuff, keeps me up and happy my whole commute.I am so pleased with the fidelity, quality and user-friendliness of this unit. It is an amazing value, especially at the Amazon price.

I upgraded to the latest (1.03) firmware version to be sure I wasn't outdated.  The camera locks up at times requiring a factory default to fix.  Of course, then you have to spend time configuring again.  I've found that turning on \"night shot\" and sending to e-mail causes a lockup 100% of the time.  I've also locked up the camera a few other times and I haven't yet figured out a pattern.2) Limited functionallity.  My other DLink cameras have nice features like upload to FTP and an image that can be pulled and used on websites and such.  This one does not.  It does have some kind of random image thing that allows you to view an image but since the filename is random, you can't do much with it.3) Missing timestamp.  When you record video, there is no date/time stamp.  Support Case ID \"DLK397450207\" from DLink: \"It does not have a date & time stamp.\"  That seems like a dumb thing to do.4) Inoperability with Server 2003.  Support Case ID \"DLK397450207\" from DLink: \"I know we tend to have issues with windows 2003 OS\".  In other words, if you're thinking about uploading images to Server 2003, forget it.I bought this because I need a low-lux camera.  When I can get a night shot picture, it does look ok.

They had sequential serial numbers, so I know the hardware was the same batch.One of the cameras works as well as can be expected, but the other one locks up very easily.  It has locked up at least 10 times under normal usage conditions, and requires the reset button to be held while connecting power to get it to work again.  Simply power cycling does not work.  This happened on firmware 1.0, 1.2 and 1.3.The camera that does work is ok and probably worth the money, but a lot of work should be done on the firmware to make it really solid.  For example, the DST setting doesn't stick, so the time-stamp on the image is always off by one hour - if it isn't completely wrong (1969).  I can set it again, but it will lose that setting next time I reboot it, or visit the settings page. The basic features work ok, but it crashes sometimes when saving settings, and you get a \"page not found\" error and have to log in again.  It also requires IE for the embedded ActiveX video viewer, and as far as I can tell, the video cannot be viewed live on Windows Media or Winamp even though it is supposedly mpeg4.So, give d-link a few months to bang out a few firmware fixes, and hopefully they will make it easier to use other streaming video viewers like WM10 or Winamp.I'm not sure I would buy it again, but I will at least keep the working camera.

The sound quality is great considering its size.  Overall though, the unit is inconvenient to use at times, because lighting on the display is poor, the buttons are too small too close together (and poorly labeled) and you need to have a spider's nest of wires attached to it at all times.  Reception is moderately good, though for some reason it used to cut out once on hour, on the top of the hour starting at 9pm.  Not sure what cosmic enigma caused that.  The remote is kind of useless, because its range is so limited that you have to point the remote in a very straight line at the receiver.  Also, since you cant see the display from more than 6 feet away because of the awful backlight, you dont know what station your tuning in.  Though really, my beef isnt with the unit as it is the service itself.  Since you cant use one without the other, here is my take on XM.  The quality of their programming is starting to decline.  The music stations are becoming as repetetive as FM stations (if I hear freakin' Bon Jovi or Green Day one more time...) and their talk channel lineup is absolutely pathetic compared to Sirius.  And now that O&A have sold out and gone terrestrial again, there's no reason to have XM for any exclusive talk content.  Also their international programming is a joke.  No BBC (except worldservice), no CBC...no international flavor at all.  They have one \"European\" station called \"u-pop\" that sounds like it was programmed by someone who's only seen London in magazines. Also, XM used to boast commercial free music channels, but this is slowly starting to dissipate.  Several of my favorite music channels have now started running commercials.  This is the whole reason I switched to a paid service in the first place!  I could almost live with it, but if you are going to bring in additional revenue from advertisers, then LOWER THE SUBSCRIPTION FEES.  Also, XM customer service is horrendous.  On the rare occasion you do get an English speaking associate, you have to wait on hold for interminable periods of time to reach them and they are often rude or clueless.  Also you cannot access any of XM's online services (including account management) unless you are using Windows, Internet Explorer (no Netscape or Firefox) and Windows Media Player.  As an audio professional, I'm sorry but Macs are better.  I should not be denied access to content that I am paying for because I use a better OS. I am though with satellite radio.  I have tried both companies and they both have a long way to go if they want to get any serious attention or subscriber base.  They really should merge...if we had Sirius' stellar programming lineup combined with XM's sound quality (Sirius' audio quality is horrendous) that would be the best thing.  Here's hoping.

Three weeks later they responded to tell me that the gamecard is not compatible with the T5 and that I should try to return it.  So now I have one game, SimCity. There is not a warning that the card will not work with the PalmOne Tungsten T5 --buyer beware"}, {"title": "512MB Cruzer Micro Drive", "review_text": "I bought this 512MB Micro drive here for price and his rating.

I've enjoyed Mah Jong although the tiles are a little hard to read and some look alike and I've read elsewhere it isn't real Mah Jong, but I don't know the difference. :-) The casino games I've played briefly but they aren't as much fun. Pool is nice but you quickly learn to beat the Palm, even on more difficult levels. And of course, SimCity is cool and it is pretty expansive. I've never played it on a regular computer before, but it was really detailed (in my opinion) and was pretty fast....All in all, I think the card will keep you happily occupied during long waits at the bank, post office, and airports.."}, {"title": "Lots of Fun and a Good Deal, Too!", "review_text": "One of my favorite computer games is Shanghai: Second Dynasty. The version on this card is obviously derived form that version of Shanghai. It really looks beautiful with the green embossed tiger and dragon background. I miss the cool music and the fortune cookie, but you can't have everything. I would try putting together some nice Chinese music on mp3's to play in the background, if mp3's didn't use so much RAM. (As an aside, I appreciate that Activision and Landware don't call it Mah Jong. This is NOT Mah Jong! Stop calling this type of game Mah Jong!!! Mah Jong is completely different.) I tried SimCity and it seems to be fairly close to the full computer version, but I haven't really used it very much, yet. The Atum game is very addictive. It can also be very frustrating when it gives you a long string of the same atum. I have had a bit of difficulty using the backgammon game. It doesn't seem to work in a very intuitive way. The checkers is fine - if checkers is your thing - it works pretty much like I expected. I can't say how smart it is, since I'm not an expert. The chess is pretty basic. I bought a more specialized separate chess game that has a lot more features, but it cost half the price of this whole card. I'm not much for slot machines, poker or blackjack, so I won't comment on those. Ricochet is a very cool looking brick breaking game. It is very nicely done. The only thing I don't like is that the background is almost as dark colored as the bricks, so sometimes the bricks are hard to see and I'm using a Tungsten T that has a pretty nice screen. 9-Ball is a fairly decent pinball game. Pinball is the one type of game that just doesn't work well on a Palm. I've tried all the versions I can find and 9-ball is one of the best. But, that's not saying much. I guess the computing power required for really good pinball is still too much for Palm machines. Strangely, though, the Billiards game does work well. Surprisingly well! And it actually has good sound effects! Not bad! Okay. So, all together that's 12 games. Several really good ones, a couple so-so. I guess it's not such a bad deal. What I realy like is that it doesn't use up my precious RAM. Figuring in the value of a small SD card, the Palm Game Essentials Card is actually a pretty good deal"}, {"title": "Over a year and still fantastic", "review_text": "Have had the SoundDock for well over a year, and the sound quality is still amazingly crisp, clear and even.  For such a small unit it is surprising how easily it fills a room with sound, with almost no distortion even at high volumes.  There is no fall-off in range or articulation of each note, even when going from a pounding base in pop/rock/disco to the delicate and intricate orchestrations in classical music as I've experienced with other speaker systems.  Often the challenge for other small bookshelf units is maintaining fidelity in classical piano pieces - notes in the upper register often sound weak, distant, and somewhat tinny.  In contrast, with this unit they are full and beautifully resonant.The remote is an easy-to-use plus, as well as the size of the unit which makes it easy to move from room to room (although I hear it clearly in the bedroom when it is playing in the living room).A troubleshooting tip:  On one occasion I could not get sound out of the speakers, nor get the unit to respond to the remote, even though the ipod was working when I used the ear phones.

As a couple of reviewers have noted, you can just keep turning it up and up with little or no sound degradation - quite amazing. The unit has a couple of small annoyances, such as the tangle of power cords and adapters in tow and the rather loose fit of 30GB video IPods, which seems to be a common theme across third party accessories.

Excellent Bass & Treble response. The best I've heard for its compact size and small footprint.Cons:1.) The SoundDock uses an external transformer. You have 13 feet of power cables to tuck away. Five feet of cable from the wall outlet to the converter (which is 4.5\"x2.5\"x1.5\") and another 8 feet of cable to the SoundDock. It's not as neat or convenient as it should be, were the converter built into the unit. For a Bose designed product, this is a major fault if you want to use it on a countertop in a kitchen environment. It also makes the SoundDock a bit less \"portable\" for anyone who would like to move it between the Kitchen, Patio, Bedroom or Family Room.2.) No external input for a second audio source.3.)

It's more like a $6-10 charger when you add in the \"shipping\" -- roughly $7.50 for one and $10.50 for two, which is really shipping, handling and profit.

There was a right side?  I then read the directions with the paper--there is indeed a right side, and it is whiter than the back.  It will be hard for some to tell the difference.  But the difference from printing on the right side and the wrong side is truly astounding! I'm a big glossy paper fan, but there is a nice look to this matte paper. And it is MUCH cheaper than the Photo Paper Pro.  It is also much cheaper than buying greeting card paper.But be aware, the money you save not buying more expensive photo paper will be going to buying more ink.  Compared to glossy paper, this paper drinks ink.  I've been making calendars with it, and was shocked to see the way the ink was consumed.  Yet, I can't see making calendars with any paper than this.  It makes beautiful calendars!  I print a borderless 8x10 photo, using my Canon photo software on the bright white side, and a calendar page, using my calendar software, on the opposite side. The pages bind very easily with a 1/4 inch plastic binding comb.  And as I said, it makes a strikingly beautiful photo calendar.Thus, if you have only one type of Canon paper on hand, I would have this one. But if you can't give up the glossy look for photos, it won't work for you. Personally, I prefer using Kodak paper when making glossy prints on my Canon. And Kodak has a satin finished paper, but there is the Kodak name all over the back.  One of the great things about this Canon paper is you can print on both sides.

This Black Ink Cartrige I am buying in advance for my IP4200 amazing printer.2. I have had Canon printers before, but this and the new 8 level ink give such better quality and run and run and run !!3. The technology in the ink makes it dry immediately and is guaranteed never to fade. There is a finer mist on how it is sprayed on.4. Lord knows why anyone would want to screw up the quality output of a Canomn printer, but cheap knockoffs of othe Canon ink products are everywhere. Just go to Staples, or a million other stores and online inkjet services.5. Something to note. The Canon printers run at less that 1/2 the price of any HP inkjets. Why? Because there is NO logic in the Canon cartridges, plus the ink is psrayed \"finer\". In most other cartridges, like the HP ink jet, their are print heads in every on of their expensive cartridges. In the Canon, there is only ONE print head that works outside of the ink units, therefore making the cartridges less expensive, being able to fill more and makes the printer a heck of a lot lesser to run, maintenance wise.So if you want to get a fine printer and grundge up the output, go after those clones.

However, doesn't support itunes format - I'll get to that in the cons.+ Has a built-in FM tuner which is of extremely high quality. My Bose home theater system could not find and play certain stations that this player can pick and play very clearly. I DIG that feature because I am an avid news listener. You can also record FM .. so those NPR programs you would want to listen to again, go ahead, record them and listen. Just be carefuul not to violate copyright laws ;-)+ The player has the BEST LCD screen size-to-player size ratio. ALL other players have dinky screens - Ipods included.+ If you just looked at this player, you'd wonder how to control it. Turn it on, hold it, and everything becomes clear ... the \"click\" controls minimize the space required for controls. This is what, frankly, won me over from Ipods.+ Wonderful support from the company. Wonderful accessories - you can actually _use_ the  headphones they put in the package, rather than having to buy better ones.+ The company is soon soming out with a 4GB version.OK .. now for the cons:- OK .. iTunes are the king of content when it comes to media players. And this player cannot play m4u - the iTunes format. Maybe thee company can come up with a firmware upgrade for that sometime soon.- Not a lot of readily-available accessories - because the iPods are the kings out there. But there are accessries available .. look them up on the web.- Nano's are 0.25 inch thick; this is about 0.5 inch thick.- Only available in white.So that's it.

There are many aspects to these cables that make them worth the money other than whether they improve your signal or not.Here are some of the items that I was very impressed with:They have a tight net encasement around the cable so the cable easily glides through and around tight spaces.The cable feels like you would expect a cable to feel.  There are no thin, weak, or sub-standard parts to the cable that wear or break after repeated usage.The thumb-screws on the connectors are right-sized and easier to handle than most.Plus, all the other stuff that the others claim doesn't matter such as the gas-injected extra RF shielding, the gold connectors, etc.RF interference does affect a digital signal exactly the same way it affects an analog signal, but because it is digital, it doesn't matter as much how weak the signal so long as the message being sent hasn't been lost.  A weaker digital signal is still read correctly whereas a weaker analog signal might not.  However if a digital signal is distorted enough that the digital message has changed, it will result in distortions in the digital picture.  Depending upon the amount of interference you have, that is unlikely to occur but is possible.Bottom line is a cheaper cable will produce a just-as-good picture, but that has never been what Monster cables are about.  They are about being able to get top quality cable, preventing most problems that can arise from using cheaper ones.

The xD \"Picture Card\" flash card comes in three flavors: standard (up to 512MB), Type M (512MB, 1GB, 2GB), and Type H (512MB or 1GB).  The \"H\" stands for \"high speed\" and is the latest format allowing in theory for reads and writes up to 3 times as fast as Type M cards.  Interestingly, Type M xD cards are 20% slower than \"standard\" 256MB or 512MB xD cards.  For capacity 512MB or above, you won't find any more standard xD's; you'll find only M or H ones.To see if your Fujifilm or Olympus camera is compatible with an M or H card, go to their websites and check out the compatibility charts.  (Amazon doesn't allow links so I can't include them here but you can e-mail me if you can't find the compatibility charts.)Sandisk xD cards are, in general, reliable, as long as you stay with 512MB or lower.  Another caveat is when you buy a Sandisk (or Fujifilm or Olympus) xD in store, be sure to get a package that's marked \"Made in Japan.\"  Only two companies actually manufacture the xD cards: Toshiba of Japan and Samsung of South Korea.  Samsung cards, in my experience, have serious quality problems and *WILL* fail sooner rather than later.  Toshiba ones are much more reliable; none of my Toshiba-made cards have failed even under heavy usage.  Therefore, you should never trust xD cards that are marked \"Made in S. Korea.\"  Be sure to shop around until you find Toshiba (\"made in Japan\") cards.  This tip will save you lots of precious memories and from lots of headaches later on.  Unfortuantely, this verification is hard to do when you shop on Amazon or online; I can only say \"good luck\"!

Takes fairly good stills, as long as it's set to 320x240.

Good luck, if you them"}, {"title": "Dissappointing", "review_text": "I have been on a bit of a quest for decent and user-friendly noise cancelling cans for a few months.  I use trains and subways to commute, and I think I did damage to my hearing years ago when I would drown out the subway noise with my headphones.  I figure noise cancellation (or reduction) technology would help prevent further damage.  I had the Sennheisser PCX-250 (list $150), which sounded reasonably good and had fairly effective noise cancellation, but was very cumbersome to use, with a lot of cords to get tangled with the remote cords on my CD player (iRiver SlimX 450).  They were fairly comfortable.  I then moved to the Aiwa branded Sony noise cancellation phones (list ~$60).  These do not have a separate battery/circuitry compartment like the Sennheissers, but instead, like the Koss QZ-50, have these built into the headset.  They are moderately comfortable but bulky.  The noise cancellation is pretty effective, although it adds a significant amount of hiss (more than the Sennheissers).  The sound overall is balanced, a little bass-heavy and ragged in the treble range, but overall quite listenable.  Best of all, the Aiwa is very sensitive, so it is easy to drive, and saves CD player batteries (since you run the player at lower volume levels to achieve the same loudness).  I tried the Koss QZ-50 because I hoped the behind-the-neck design would be more comfortable and less geeky looking.  Also, I love the Porta-Pros, and was hoping the QZ-50 would sound like them.  The QZ-50s sound just OK.  Not very extended in the bass, no better than the Aiwas up top.  They are fairly comfortable, although the earcups tended to slip down off my ears when I walked.  Unfortunately, while the noise cancellation processing does not add any significant hiss, it also doesn't seem to reduce noise at all.  Add to that the QZ-50s high impedance (which requires higher volume settings on the player), and the QZ-50 is not worth keeping.  I'd try the more expensive Koss QZ based on the Porta-Pro, but it, too, uses a separate, wired compartment for batteries and circuitry.  I do not recommend the QZ-50 as a solution for listening in noisy environments"}, {"title": "For the price...amazing", "review_text": "This was an impulse buy because they were being liquidated at a local store and so I got them for half the Amazon price.  But after hearing them I have to say that the sound is amazing even if they were full retail.  I also own the Bose noise canceling headset which sells for $300 and they are incredible at disposing background noise; much more so than these QZ50's. Noise canceling on these is really silly to expect. That being said, I really think the actual sound reproduction is similar, which is unbelievable since the Bose cost almost 10 times as much.  I don't use the Bose headset unless I am sitting in one place since it has a very inconvenient two square inch box on the cord that holds the battery and the on/off switch which would just hang like an anchor if you were walking or moving around.  The over-the-ear design of the Koss seemed like they would be uncomfortable, but after wearing them for an hour or more at a time, I almost forget that they are there.  The sound reproduction is clear, smooth and consistent.  I think they are incredible for the price and would highly recommend them.  This is being added months later: I find that I rarely use the Koss now, mostly because of their size and the fact that I looked in the mirror and I look like a Star Trek Borg wearing them.  Also, they do require a lot to push them, so the volume is at best modest"}, {"title": "Uncomfortable and not much in the way of Noise Cancellation", "review_text": "I was very disappointed with the Koss QZ50.

This is achieved by the use of a radio frequency and therefore it does not require a 'line of sight' with your GPS unit. The remote also allows you to easily adjust the volume of the audio instructions by the use of the top two -/+ buttons. In the center it has a radial dail that has up/down and left/right cursor functions as well as a large enter/select button in the center. There are two more buttons below this radial dail that I'm unclear as to their funtions, I believe they may also adjust the volume, but that seems to be redundant. There is one more button located bottom-center that I assumed to be an on/off button but it (nor any other button) did not serve in that capacity, if anything it appeared to be another enter/select button....again redundant. I've only had this device a couple of days and perhaps those buttons do serve as shortcuts to certain funtions, but with TomTom not providing any instructions other than how to insert the batteries along with descriptions merely touting its convenience, I'm left to tinkering with it myself to discover if any other funtions do indeed exist. There is also a protective holder included with the remote, that if you wish you can utilize the adheasive backing on it to mount it to any easily accessible place in your vehicle. I chose not to permanantly mount my remote's holder as I use my TomTom Go 700 in different vehicles, but that's a personal preference, who knows maybe these holders are, or will be available to purchase separately to mount in multiple vehicles."}, {"title": "Poor Quality", "review_text": "I've gotten virtually no benefit from this.

Finally found my Tivo remote after it decided to wedge itself into my recliner for the umpteenth time. I finally decided to check Amazon for a \"find the remote\" solution and found the Ultra 8.Just got my Ultra 8 today and immediately put it to work placing the receiver units with my cell phone case, a couple of remotes, keys of immense importance to me and even a camera. By the time I was done, I had only one spare unit and I decided that I'd keep that one as the \"floater\" receiver for misc purposes.The box/packaging is good. Seems like it makes sense to keep the box for future moves/maintenance and you get a little screwdriver for maintaining the batteries in the little receiver units. You also get instructions, extra stickers for labeling on the transmitter (2 sets of stickers) and about 8 velcro sticker circles for stickingt the receivers to remotes/etc. I can see that the velcro will eventually not work but figure I can rig some sort of strap to couple the receiver buckle to at a later date. For now, it works and that is all that is important.The transmitter has a cool little magnet system for sticking to a central location so you know where to go to find the \"finder\" (so to speak). I stuck mine in my kitchenette, right on my microwave. Worked out great and the magnet does a good job of sticking to the oven while the secondary magnet holds the transmitter to the hook with zero issues. Altogether, a quality storage solution and well thought out by the manufacturer.I did test the transmitter with the receivers in various common locations that my stuff seems to migrate to with permission (of course!) and while the transmitter signal did reach across the room at times, it seems to work best with you in close proximity to the lost item. So, be willing to walk around and \"scan\" in a systematic fashion. No problem there with a studio apartment like mine, but in a large house, you will need to be patient and just keep scanning until you find the item.I think I'll order the extra receivers for additional lost-item tracking in a seperate office area.

This whole assembly is then joined via a single IDE interface to a separate board that converts FireWire800, FireWire400 and/or USB 2.0 to IDE.

Once again the micro-tractix horns and the way they cleverly engineered the cabinets for the woofers give these little speakers the power of giants.Reality check, these guys make speakers from $100/pair to several thousand dollars a piece.  Klipsch is the only company to publish a really full set of specifications on everything they make, because they have nothing to hide.

It takes far more than a simple head tilt to jar them loose and, at the same time, they felt very comfortable in my ear.Next, I plugged them into my DVD player. When I read about the \"high sonic output\" in the product description I thought it was nothing more than hyperbole used by Sony to sell it's product. Not only is it NOT hyperbole, but it may even be an understatement. These headphones produce tremendous output, almost too much. I compared the levels with another conventional set of headphones (also Sony). To get the same output in the other headphone as the 21's at volume level 1 I had to adjust the volume level to 6. This is a huge advantage as listening at lower levels obviously causes less drain on the battery.To get a better idea of how they sounded I played one of the  concert DVD's I have.

The sound was crisp, the bass was adequate and most of all they didn't sound \"tinny\". Also, they do block out a fair amount of external noise, but not completely.

Sony DVPNS50P.DECEMBER 2005: I have only had this item for about three weeks or so.  I am hoping that it \"holds up\" over time, unlike a lot of other DVD players on the market that apparently fail so quickly they are practically disposable in nature.The \"pros\" on this item (so far) are:* sleek, slim, uncluttered look of the unit* comes in either black or silver, so you can match it up to your other devices.* easy set up.  There's a electrical plug, trip-RCA jacks and an S-video jack. Hook-up is a snap.  Hardware-wise, the device, then, is really uncluttered.* seems to be a good deal for the price.The \"cons\" (so far) are:* as said elsewhere by other reviewers... it IS slow.  Slow to boot a disc. Slow to re-start a disc that has been stopped. Just slow.* the display readout on the front of the box.  It scrolls words like \"welcome,\" \"open\" \"close\" and \"no text.\"  The firmware engineer was apparently out to lunch on this one. There's not even a clock display. It will display the time the DVD has played, thank goodness.*the on-screen menu is pretty lame. Must have been the same engineer. The menu choices are only displayed as cryptic graphics, and the choices for each graphic are brief and uninformative (as in \"on, off, auto\" or similar types of statements). You will absolutely have to work through the manual to figure it out.  And you won't find a lot of useful functionality after you do.  It is a pretty bare-bones box.* The remote control could use a good bit of improvement.  The text is large enough to read ... but the buttons barely protrude from the face.  You have to grasp this thing firmly, get your finger right on the button and apply a good bit of pressure to score.  And a lot of the buttons can't be pushed while the thing is sitting on the coffee table ... the back of the device is beveled at the top, so if you press on the buttons near the top -- common usage buttons like TV on/off, box on/off and open/close -- while it is sitting on a level surface, the thing just flips up in the air. And the range is horrid. It can't handle getting its signal over the edge of my coffee table three feet away from the box. You've got to pick it up and aim it directly at the device if you want the box to respond. There's no facilitation for using the remote at night (no glow in the dark, backlighting, light-through, etc.) AND the remote came in silver.  Who at Sony thought that I would want a silver remote if I bought a black box?  Was molding cases for the remote in two different colors too big a challenge for them ... or did it just make it easier for Sony to manage its inventory?* The box has already told me \"no disc\" incorrectly a couple of times.  Jogging it opened and closed resolved the issue.  Either the tray is not designed to align the disc 100% when inserted ... or this is an indication the device is going to have read problems down the road. Time will tell.Still, IF it is quality, IF it is durable, then it's worth what I paid for it.UPDATE: September, 2006.  After owning one for almost a year ... and buying two more this summer ... I can still recommend this unit.  Every once in a great while, it gets confused enough so that I have to unplug it from the wall to \"reboot it.\" It has tracked flawlessly on almost every DVD ... just a freeze here and there on some heavily used Netflix rentals. I do not see any evience of dual-layer freezing. This SKU is out of production, but the current SKU (Sony DVPNS55P)doesn't look much different and so it is probably just as reliable."}, {"title": "Sony single disc DVD player", "review_text": "The Sony single disc DVD player lives up to the glowing reviews that were published in the Amazon website.

The AC adapter is slightly smaller than the i300's and comes in one piece instead of two. And it all fits in the provided carrying case.Unfortunately, the Sony has the same problem as the i300 even though the Sony carton says, and I quote: \"The embedded Mega Bass delivers rich bass regardless of the sound volume.\" Sorry folks, it ain't true. Like the i300, the Sony bass cracks up at \"high\" (not really that loud) volumes. I'd say the Sony handles the bass better than the i300, but not by much.

This kind of amps costs a dollar or two to make in quantity. The bass from the speakers was being enhanced by a silicon rubber tube acting as a port (no wonder that one tone bass sound). Believe me - if you know electronics and a bit of audio - prepare to be shocked when you open this device up! No more than a few dollars worth of components inside and a design that even I can better!Now fast forward to Christmas 2005 - my brother presented me with the Creative i300. I'm just blown away with the sound quality of this one. Nice bass, good treble and overall very clean room filling sound. And they claim to have a digital amp (my batteries do last and last).

The area where the driver connects to the head band breaks easily, causing the headphones to either fall off of the headband, or become unbalanced, often causing the side affected to jet out away from your ear.  The only fix that I have managed is to tightly run tape around the perimeter of the casing, and then tie a string around it for reinforcement; of course you can also do what I did and throw them in the garbage after only about 8 months use.  The Sony MDR-V700 also does not faithfully reproduce sound, so using these as studio monitors or even just hi-fi listening is simply absurd.  The frequency response curve is shifted heavily toward the lower frequencies, which often dulls the mid-high to high end frequencies.  These are also extremely heavy, overbearing headphones that are quite uncomfortable to wear for long periods of listening.  I often experienced tension headaches after wearing these simply because they pull on my ears and scalp so much.  Finally, sound leaks out of these headphones like crazy.  If you're looking for something to record with, monitor with, or just be non-intrusive with, these are definitely not the headphones for you.  In short, if you want a low-end overpriced headphone that's flashy, these are for you.  If you want a headphone that accurately reproduces sound, is non-intrusive, and wears comfortably, then I recommend AKG for home/casual listening, and Etymotic for mobile listening.  They're volumes more expensive than the MDR-V700, but the quality is worth it"}, {"title": "Still going strong after SIX YEARS", "review_text": "I just purchased my second pair after neglecting to maintain my old pair. The old ones still sound GREAT, but unfortunately I didn't bother to maintain the leather part of the headphones well, so they started cracking, and after dropping them, one of the swivels stopped working, so they didn't stay on right.With minimal precautions, you too can make these last for years and years - just apply some leather protector once in a while, and take care not to drop the things carelessly on the floor. These things are the best headphones I've ever owned, and it was well worth another $100 to purchase a second pair. The first pair served me well, and actually sound great still - they're just not comfortable, due in NO part to the quality of the headphones themselves.They are solid, and it's nice to have a cord on only one side. It really gets in your way a lot less than the typical headphone design with a cord on each side.Highly recommend these even for those of you who aren't DJs. These are perfect for drowning out the sound of my coworkers at my desk.

Some people have had enormous problems with this product and I am one of them. Whether you will have problems or not depends on your network configuration and OS/Service packs. If you have a wireless network in your house and you need to connect this printer to it, you could be in for some unpleasant surprises! The problems that I will describe have been documented and acknowledged by HP and has not nothing to do with not following instructions.So ignore those who dismiss negative reviews with statements like \"read the directions stupid and follow them EXACTLY\". Later in this review I will give you some information for those of you who have been unlucky enough to encounter the well known problems with this product.First, even though I like the print quality of this device I have some complaints about hardware problems I encountered. The first two printers I bought did not work due to hardware issues, right out of the box, so I returned them to the store. However, my third printer worked. However, it broke on the day my warranty expired. I called the next day and the HP representative noticed that my warranty expired the day before. However, he was kind enough to still honor my warranty which I am very grateful for. Therefore I am not giving this product one star but two.Because I switched networks, and network configuration, had a hard disk crash, switched printers, and other issues, I had to install and reinstall the software several times. This in itself is a negative (having to reinstall the software). However, I also encountered issues with the software on the CD, and these issues have nothing to do with not following instructions as acknowledged by HP. If you need to install the printer as part of a wireless network you could end up having the following problems;-- svchost.exe will start throwing exceptions when you open internet explorer or even windows explorer, and you will get four svchost exceptions every time you restart your computer (this is very bad).-- If this happens during installation, your installation may fail and some capabilities will never be installed (you may not be able to scan or print). If this happens it may not help to re-install the installation software.So if you need to install this printer on a wireless network instead of using the installation CD you should down load the updated installation software from HP. HP support staff will tell you from where you can get this, I am not allowed to you give the url here.It is possible that this update is on the newer installation CD's but you should check that before you install. Also verify everything I am saying with HP support (HP support is good). If you have already installed the software and you are getting strange svchost.exe exception errors or the printer is missing some features, then you need to do a complete uninstall and use the installation update mentioned above. What I mean with a complete uninstall is that just uninstalling the software from the control panel is not good enough. You also need to clean out the registry and delete some files located in the windows operating system.You need to do the following:A. Remove entries from Add/Remove programs.B. Remove entries from Printers and Faxes folder.C. Remove entries from Registry.D. Remove folders from C:\\WindowsI could give the elaborated steps if someone wants me to do so, however, you could just ask HP support for these instructions. These instructions will work, but nothing else will (experience).However, my major point is, if you are not prepared to do this every time you need to change your wireless network you should look for another product."}, {"title": "The best printer I've ever used", "review_text": "I can't say enough about this product.

They are very portable, and can fold very easily. They are relatively comfortable (if not as comfortable as the px200's, which I've tried). Soundwise, I really enjoy the overall presentation of sound in my music: the bass is punchy but not too powerful, and the mids and highs sound Sennheiser great. Where with some Sennheiser headphones bass is lacking, in my opinion the px100's bass is at least passable... it's punchy, and natural, realistic presentation of bass (in contrast to sony's and other headphones in which bass screams through and often ends up distorting the music). Because of this, the headphones sound good with a broader range of music, different from headphones such as the hd555's (which I own) that sound much better with jazz over rap.Outside the home, I've been a bit frustrated. Because they leak sound I've found that you probably will want to turn it down so people around you don't become annoyed, but also, because of this openness of sound I've also found that outside noise can be bothersome while you listen. As long as it's relatively quiet, these are fine for jogging, flying in a plane, etc. But in loud, noisy environments, it can get difficult to listen. That's why I took off 1 star.Overall- 4.5 stars. if you're looking for portable headphones or headphones for a portable, or want a cheap but quality headphone, or a headphone for listening to a broad range of music, I highly recommend these"}, {"title": "The best I've heard from a package that pleases as much as these do.", "review_text": "I did a lot of online research for headphones in this price range.  The reviews kept coming to this product.  So what the heck.  I went for them.  Found them at a price that made it well worth the effort.  Then they arrived....  If I'd known that they were this good I would have paid top dollar without complaint.The headphones did exactly what I wanted from this product.  The open air design lets me hear what's going on around me, (Which makes them wonderful for work!) yet I still hear lots, I mean lots, of musical detail.  And the bass pumps without pushing my eardrums into my brain, clean and tight.  The ergonomics are very good as well.  You can wear these babies for hours without any discomfort.  They are light on the ear and the head.  The folding design is cool.  It shouldn't be the reason you buy these though.  The case is handy and will keep the headphones from harm during travel, but it seems a bit bulky.  You can't really use the case and expect to slip it into your coat pocket without someone knowing that you're \"packing\".  Again, that's not why I love these headphones.  It all comes back to the sound.  And it is great.Parents, buy these for your iPod using children.

But they sound VERY good for the price. They're small enough and cheap enough to wind around your fingers & toss in your pocket.The only thing I don't really like about them is their thin, rubbery cord which doesn't drape well and feels really cheap. But you know what? I bet it was a conscious design descision because this rubbery cord is MUCH more impervious to tangling than the Shures I owned.  It was always a mini-ordeal to undo the Shure cords because they had such \"memory\" that they tended to get tangled.One other thing - I think they have a good balance of letting in the outside world while isolating enough to provide good sound. You don't have to push them in near as far as Shures to get a good seal.Couple tips:- I thought maybe I could try Shure tips on these, but no because the \"neck\" that the ear rubber fits around is too wide.- Don't like wax?

Instead, I'll focus on the flaws that have  slightly marred my experience, though not enough for me to regret my purchase. I'm still glad that I bought it.As soon as I read about the new iPod nano, I ordered one straight from Apple. I liked the Mini with its all-metal body, and have been wishing I could get a Nano like that since the Nano came out. However, I'm somewhat disappointed with the diminished quality of this new iPod compared to the previous iPods I've owned -- the a 20GB 4G (I've owned two) and the first-generation Mini.A lot has been written about the great new features of this new iPod, so I won't get into those much. Other than the nice small form factor and the 8 gigabytes of space, I like the new volume lock feature the most.This list is grouped into several categories.Design Flaws:The center button is now slightly recessed instead of being slightly raised like in previous models. When the button was raised, it was a lot easier to follow around the scroll wheel with my thumb.The screen is hard to read without backlight. With older monochrome screens, which work just fine for reading what song I am listening to, I could read it without the backlight in all but the darkest environments.The GUI is often jerky. My hypothesis is that previous iPods used separate chips for the GUI and for the audio decoding and the GUI, while this one uses the same one.The \"Now Playing\" screen displays some titles center-aligned, some left-aligned. I haven't figured out what the deciding factor is.The headphone jack being on the bottom is very inconvenient. This is obviously a personal preference when you are talking about just walking around with the iPod. But this also makes it virtually impossible to unplug the data/charging cable without first unplugging the headphones.Software Bugs:Apple has already released firmware version 1.1.1 for this iPod. I have installed this firmware. Despite this, I have already discovered several bugs in the software:Album sorting seems to happen based on several factors other than the track number. In one nine-track album, the first track was actually listed and played last. I was able to remedy this by clearing all the tags other than artist, album, year, and track number for all tracks in this album.It seems to choke on certain files that play fine in other players. I have yet to figure out a pattern.Quality Flaws:The screen in my iPod is slightly crooked. This is, in my opinion, unacceptable from a \"premium\" music player. I admit that this would not bother everyone.The hold button has some play, and often the orange hold indicator shows through despite the hold switch being off.The center button (and the entire scroll wheel area) also has a lot of play. I imagine that, beyond communicating a lower quality level, this would also invite dust and dirt inside of the iPod"}, {"title": "Waited Until Now To Buy One!

I downloaded and installed a driver for OSX 10.3.9 from www.sustworks.com/site/news_usb_ethernet.html, and the Linksys USB200M works flawlessly on my eMac.HOWEVER, regarding the quality of this device...I wish I had read the other reviews on Amazon before buying the Linksys. I totally agree that it is very flimsy and poorly designed. When you open the little door on the side, the door itself creates a side to the jack where your ethernet cable will plug in. And the door is so flimsy (see the other reviews), that if it comes off, your cable will no longer stay attached. Plus, when you plug a cable into it, you get an awkward, stiff connection at a 45 degree angle. Fortunately, it does come with a short extension cable to make this connection more flexible for tight spaces. The removeable dust cap is pretty useless (does the USB plug really need to be protected?)

I recommend them to anyone.

The QuietComfort 3 are the brand new version, they cost more, and they are \"smaller and lighter\". They offer pretty much the exact same noise cancelling quality, but they fit on top of your ear vs being a larger, bulky around the ear style like the QuietComfort 2.However, when I tested out the QuietComfort 3 for a month, I found them to be quiet painful. Not in a \"pressure on the ear\" sense - they were quite comfortable to wear. Rather, when you turned them on, the pressure they exerted on the actual eardrum in order to \"cancel noise\" hurt. It was a physical sensation, when you turned them on and felt that WHOMP of wave energy pressing against your eardrum. Anybody who thinks the QuietComfort 2 is uncomfortable in that sense hasn't tried the QuietComfort 3 yet.Yes, I realize that in order to cancel out ambient sound waves, there has to be an opposite sound wave to cancel them out. It's simple physics. However, because the QuietComfort 2 is an around-the-ear design, it doesn't have to blast that cancelling wave right at your eardrum. The larger \"air area\" being encapsulated by the ear cups gives you more area to work with, and you can block out the sounds without bombarding the ear canal with signals. I did numerous tests with the QuietComfort 2, with my set of iPod playlists that had left-only and right-only sounds, and even during the quiet parts, it was quite comfortable.Also, as much as people might say that the QuietComfort 2 has \"large\" ear pods, I really didn't find them bad at all. I was able to sleep with them, wear them without feeling silly at all. The case, in fact, is about the exact same size as the QuietComfort 3 case.In all, I am EXTREMELY happy that I traded in my QuietComfort 3 headphones for the larger but \"kinder\" QuietComfort 2 set. The noise cancelling ability is pretty much exactly the same, and the long term comfort is FAR superior. Plus, since the QuietComfort 2 takes batteries vs rechargeable plug-in items, it means if I drain the battery, I simply plunk in new ones.

I purchased the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones right before I departed on a 5 day, 3 city trip.From the moment I put them on I knew this was a breakthrough product. Sure - I noticed something akin to pressure on my ears but that sensation passed in a few minutes. It's just like getting used to wearing a watch - you end up not noticing it at all after a short time. What has not passed is the joy in letting the rest of the world just fall away so that I can get some down time while traveling.Not only was the background noise from the plane's engines gone, but I could actually turn the volume down on my Creative Zen Vision much lower than would be the case with other headphones because the music wasn't competing with the roar of the engines.The same with the volumn while watching movies - I didn't have to crank up the volume just to hear what was being said. I could even hear the dialogue of movies played on my laptop and those played by the airline. I cannot emphasize this point enough - for the first time ever, I could actually hear music and videos without cranking up the volume to the max - saving my ears from damage as well as avoiding dirty looks from my fellow passengers.On my honeymoon, my wife and I both brought along a pair. Being able to distance ourselves from all the background noise really did increase the relaxation factor and allowed us to travel 12 hours each way in relative peace. Speaking of honeymoons - this item would be a GREAT wedding gift. There is nothing worse than to spend your time enroute to some fabulous tropical destination for your honeymoon listening to the kids behind you scream while their father snores away.Even at home, my wife will sometimes wear her headphones while reading. It completely eliminates any noise from the television in the next room.Contrary to what one other reviewer has stated, the sound from these headphones is anything but distorted. I find that I can hear subtleties in music that I cannot hear over my home entertainment system. The fact that I can still hear these subtleties while in a loud environment is an added bonus.You probably will not wear these headphones while in the gym (though I have actually seen people wearing them while on the treadmill at my local gym - the same type of people that wear designer workout shorts). There are also times where you don't need noise reduction. For these times, I have inexpensive headphones. I would not however deduct any points from Bose for making a specialty set of headphones just because they are not perfect for all situations. I would not take points off my favorite leather jacket because I can't wear it to the beach in July.Yes, these things are expensive.

No, they don't reach from the summit to the pub at the bottom, but again that is a line of sight issue - have realistic expectations for a $45 radio.  They did however reach between the summits of Whistler and of Blackcomb.  That seems like a reasonable range to me.  Check out a map and see if you agree.There's a comment in another review about them not seating well in the charger.  This is true, but there is a super-simple remedy.  There's a cradle for the handset that nests into the charger.  If you remove the cradle, fit it on the handset, and then slide the two into the charger - presto, problem solved.One feature I really like that isn't made obvious in the description is that the rechargeable battery is the same size and shape if three AA batteries.  This is a nice option if your battery dies on the road, and your charger is at home.All in all, I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.

At any volume level it was fuzzy, muddy and completely distorted.  This was equally irritating on either radio.  There was no interference, no static, just inconceivable communication.  I also tried other GMRS radios from other manufacturers and found some to be identical, and one to be perfect.  Among the others was another Motorola brand that was much higher in price and featured higher quality, but sounded exactly the same.  So I think it's a design flaw in thier speakers.

After going through the motions with Tech support (update drivers, good power source, correct hook-ups, etc.) they couldn't help me unless it was flickering at that moment. The next day it would stay off more than it would flicker on. Called Tech support and they confirmed it was a serious problem. It was packed up and sent back to Amazon for a replacement.The next one arrived and I have had the same problems. What are the chances of two bad monitors in a row? Very good if the serial numbers are close together. I called Tech support and they admitted to a QC problem on a production run of monitors.I am giving this monitor two stars because I feel the picture and brightness are outstanding.

Fine details in dark scenes can be washed out in a field of dark gray.  At the lowest brightness and backlight levels (which are separately controllable), true black can still not be obtained (and at those settings other scenes will be too dark).  Bright scenes, however, look fantastic with excellent detail and color reproduction.  For most viewers, the black level issue should be only an occasional annoyance, if that.Screen proportions can also be changed easily with a button on the remote, allowing you to optimize screen fill for standard vs. HD broadcasts, or wide-screen vs. standard-view DVDs.  The design of this unit is unique and pretty cool.  The speakers are mounted on a glass plate that surrounds the base unit.  The unit also has a removable steel plate on the back that can be used to do a simple flush wall-mount (it's not a swiveling or adjustable wall mount unit, like those often sold separately).In five years, improved flat screen display technologies will probably make you want to replace this unit and move it to a bedroom.

I have never had a problem of ergonomically \"incorrect\" with these mice.  Being in animation, I do a lot moving and placing of objects in the programs I use.

I wish it had more of an equalizer, instead of only allowing a slight variation between bass and treble. The extra bass feature is good though. I've heard the models from Panasonic and believe they have TOO MUCH bass! The Sony's remote is pretty good, except I wish it had numeric access for the station presets. This raises my BIGGEST complaint; when tuning a preset AM or FM station, the preset \"number\" appears in the display right before the frequency, separated only by a \"dash\". For example if you're tuned to 101.3 and the station preset is #4, the display would read \"4-101.3\" or if it's #17 it'll say \"17-101.3\" In my opinion the preset number should be smaller that the frequency digits or be in a different portion of the display.

Better than my old Aiwa. The tape however, is NOT auto reverse!

The Grundig (now Eton) FR-200 is a small \"auxiliary\" AM-FM portable which adds general shortwave radio coverage, an LED flashlight, and a three-way power design that allows for a quick \"pick-me-up\" to a replaceable and inexpensive rechargeable NiMH battery pack similar to one used in the typical cordless phone.  A few minutes of cranking, `n you're back in broadcast business.  With these options, it's virtually impossible for this radio to not find \"juice\".  The FR-200 is imported by Eton from Tecsun in mainland China, and is marketed exclusively as an \"emergency radio\"...but I'm thinking--\"perfect for the canoe and camping trip\" where one wouldn't wish to lose something more costly to the elements.The reviews on this product have run the course--from favorable--to horrible.  This would clearly indicate either a serious quality control problem...a lack of reviewer perspective on just WHAT objective this product was designed to meet...or both.  After pondering this unique little $40 radio for over two years, I finally unwrapped and evaluated one (the package exterior said \"yellow\"--a neon-orange model waited inside).  The FR-200 is less than HALF THE COST of its most-similar alternative--the Freeplay Summit (which I have ordered--and twice returned because of substandard performance), so I was somewhat skeptical of this product format.  Upon closer examination and use, the less-expensive Grundig (while not brimming with \"digital glitz\" and rows of small silver buttons) is higher in overall performance, easier to pack and carry, and much more \"disposable\" should that situation arise.  My prior skepticism has turned into consumer gratification.  This product is satisfying, useful, and an unquestionable value.  Here are my performance observations...AUDIO QUALITY:  The sound of the FR-200 is crisp, clear, and natural.  While far from \"room shaking\"--this unit is fine as a close-in companion; and more-than-adequate for its intended purpose as a standby \"blackout radio\", or convenient portable \"sidekick\" at home, in camp, or out on the water.RECEPTION ON FM:  The worst goes first...The FM capabilities of the FR-200 are sad to barely acceptable, depending on your listening location.  In a small community, ANY nearby local station with brawny signal strength will overload the circuits in this radio to a point that renders it nearly useless--unless you enjoy the offending local station, which will populate itself on nearly the entire FM dial--crowding out even not-so-distant stations from out-of-town.  In an urban area, with many powerful \"close-in\" signals, the FM band becomes a jumbled and distorted mess where \"ONLY the strong survive\"--but barely!  Interestingly, out in fringe areas, where brutish FM signals are few and far in-between, the band shows signs of intelligible life...a plus for rural listening!RECEPTION ON AM:  Other than a few expensive \"AM niche\" and world-band receivers, the FR-200 is possibly one of THE BEST portable AM radios you can own!  Sensitivity, selectivity (in the absence of a strong local station), and recovered audio quality are OUTSTANDING!  NEVER have I seen a radio in this class (and several other classes for that matter) that provides as rich an AM listening experience.  During the daytime, even very distant AM signals are intelligible and less-assailed by the all-to-familiar \"circuit noise\" that hinders weak AM station listening on most radios.  Sensitivity remains consistent from the low (530 kHz) to the high (1700 kHz) end of the band--NOT typical for an AM receiver section in a radio at this price point.  Right \"out of the box\" my FR-200 easily caught, and faithfully reproduced in early afternoon, six AM stations from Chicago--over 250 miles from my location.  At night, this radio becomes a pint-sized DX-delight.  Virtually EVERY channel is \"alive\", yet moderate-to-strong signals remain \"separated\" and fully intelligible.  In the rare occasion that you may find, and choose to listen to, an AM station with a music format--you will find a hint of \"hi-fi\" in the reproduced audio.  This level of AM performance is usually the domain of the \"CC Radios\" of the market; and at less than one-quarter of their cost--the FR-200 is an \"AM standout\".  Here's another possible application: Your FR-200's headphone jack + a patch cord + the line input on your surround-sound = FAR BETTER AM reception and audio on that system.RECEPTION ON SHORT WAVE:  Plainly put--it is \"pedestrian\" at best.  If you're shopping for shortwave agility--continue your search.  Nor do I recommend this radio as an entry into \"the world of shortwave\", either. The SW feature on this product is obviously a \"convenience item\"--which turns out to be operationally inconvenient at times.  The technical idiosyncrasies of that band are such that the ability to optimally receive it demands a product design with a distinct focus.  Interestingly, Eton-Grundig is a \"shortwave company\" that DOES NOT market the FR-200 as a \"shortwave radio\"...It merely \"includes\" that feature.THE GOOD ON SW: Prominent domestic and international broadcasters with big signals WILL find their way to your tiny FR-200, and strong stations can sound fairly good on this radio.  In early afternoon (NOT a preferable SW listening day-part), I found the higher band (\"SW-2\") to be fairly-populated, and I was able to receive tiny 1000-watt CFRX Toronto, Canada here in the Midwest on the lower (inactive-by-day) \"SW-1\" band--a \"catch\" typical for a more-expensive rig designed for SWL.   At night, on the active lower frequencies (\"SW-1\"), reception is generally decent with the built-in telescoping rod antenna, and can be improved with a \"roll-up alligator-clip\" wire antenna ($15 at \"The Shack\").  Unlike many small SW radios, the FR-200 can tune well below 49-meters (6 MHz)...even down to 90-meters (3 MHz) where several obscure domestic and western-hemisphere stations live by night.  The laws of physics--and the laws of \"affordable design\" generally work to inhibit easy reception on these channels (if available) on low-cost SW radios.  My FR-200 did an admirable job of snagging several of these signals with only its included antenna.THE NOT-SO-GOOD ON SW: Little is gained thru a decent receiver design if the user can't find or identify a desired station.  Imagine tuning a radio with your eyes closed.  That would describe the experience of hunting for a SW station on the FR-200 solely based on frequency info.  Three design factors (I should say)--design compromises make this radio a chore to tune overall--and nearly impossible to \"direct tune\" on shortwave.  (1) This receiver's \"single-conversion\" RF design permits strong signals to repopulate themselves on an additional frequency--causing interference to other stations and confusion for the user.  (2) Nearly the entire shortwave service is \"squeezed\" into two \"bands\" that occupy a minimal 1.75-inches of band-spread.  Now that's \"touchy tight\", especially when you consider that... (3) This unit's manual slide-rule tuning (coarse and fine) is \"mushy\", and the numerical frequency layout is poorly calibrated.IN SUMMARY: What we have here is a nearly-charming, color-coordinated campsite or canoe companion that can't come up short on \"juice\"--but CAN provide acceptable sound and outstanding AM radio reception in the middle of nowhere.  A demure radio that throws in a nice bright tent-filling LED light so you can try to find that hyper-paranoid \"end-of-the-world\" shortwave talk show host to go with your adult beverages around the campfire.  Even this radio's dismal FM reception might be mitigated by the location you tote it to, but I wouldn't bet on finding your favorite Jazz-Fest on \"Wilderness 98.1\", so few points are lost!  There are more-expensive products in this class that do NO better job--and cheaper offerings that do NO job at all.

The route was Houston, to Corpus Christi, to San Antonio, Austin, and back to Houston.  The 2000 Acura TL that we have has navigation but it's too small for a family trip.  So we took the van and the Cobra Nav One with us.  At first, it was love at first sight.  The unit is gorgeous!!  The bright touchscreen was big, bigger than any other competitors unit.  And bright, oh boy, even during midday in Texas sun at the beach, being mounted on the dash, the unit was easily readable and legible.  Best I have seen yet.  The map data it has was incredible.  Even the tiniest nooks and cranes in the backroad is contained here.  Even the slightest curves on the road is acknowleged.  The bazillions of interest points it has came in real handy when you're in a strange town looking for a particular restaurant.Those are the good pointsThe downside comes, when you actually use the main feature of the unit, navigation and routing.  The software is one of the dumbest I have used.  It's routing capability is not nearly as flexible nor as dynamic as the navigation system that comes stock with the 2000 Acura TL.  Once the route is set, the Nav One unit will STICK to it.  If you change direction, it will keep nagging you to turn around, 70 miles turn around, to return to the original route, instead of making a new one.  The only way to fix that, is to go back to Main menu, and choose the destination again.  Only then it will reroute with the new direction.  The Acura TL navigation does all that automatically.  Much smarter than the Nav One...  The routing itself is majorly flawed as well.  We did not get lost in Corpus Christi, as it is a small city with simple laid out.  That changed quickly as we got to San Antonio.  The unit got us lost multiple of times.  At one point, it tried to get us to drive into a 1-way street, the opposite direction...  At another, we drove under a bridge and the Nav One lost signal and shuts itself off instead of staying on to reconnect  o_0.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Cobra Nav One.  It is gorgeous and flashy, target for thieves no doubt.  However, all the bells and whistles become meaningless if the navigation and routing do not work properly.  The unit is going to be returned.  Until next time, Cobra...Pros:1) BIG bright screen, one of the best in the market.  Easy to read in daylight.2) Jam packed interest points3) It's sexy and gets you the ladies4) Very very detailed mapping.Cons:1) Routing and rerouting are broken2) The software is not very smart.3) Signal loss = automatic shut down4) Did I mention the routing and rerouting are broken"}, {"title": "Not bad but...", "review_text": "I bought this but I have found several flaws.  First let me mention that the unit that made me decide I needed GPS was an option in the 2006 Honda Odyssey that happens to be made by alpine.My first problem with it was the altimeter; although most won't use it, it was a feature that I liked.  Unfortunately it was completely worthless, my parking space in front of my house ranged from 120Ft one day to 0 feet 2 days later.  I know my house or parking space did not move so that fault is on the unit.  Also when driving the unit would claim you climbed 200 feet when you drove less than 50 feet forward sometimes.My next problem was direction; it would take me on back roads rather than highways even though I said I prefer highways.  And as you drove the screen did not flow, instead it would reload taking a second or two to reload the map and the icons.  Both the Honda and my friends G35 flowed without this, and the graphics between the 3 the cobra clearly loses out.  The graphics are substandard.  Also the unit only calls out numbers for roads, if the road is not a road with numbers (IE a highway) it just says turn left or right, which when driving in the city can be frustrating as you cannot be looking at it constantly.  Finally the house number portion was off quite a bit (1/10 of a mile or so).Next was traffic, this was rarely right, not sure if any other GPS units are right, but this would say there was an accident at one place and it would end up being off 1 or 2 miles (This was in the Baltimore/Washington area), I ended up using the radio traffic people more times than not.Next was the Points of interest function.  On the Honda it showed signs for an Exxon, or BP.  The Cobra does not, it shows an icon for Gas or Food, and while trying to drive you have to touch the area on the screen you are looking at, than press the screen at the top to get a listing of what was there.  While driving in the city, and looking for a McDonalds this is not an option.Last was the suction cup mounting bracket, for a unit of this weight it is under engineered to hold it.  The first 5 minutes I drove with it, it fell.  Agreeable it was right after I cleaned the windshield so it was not completely dry.  The next time was the last time I did not take it off before leaving my vehicle.  It was after a snow storm came through and the condensation that occurred between the windshield and the suction cup was enough to make it lose contact and fall again.  For a unit that costs 800+ bucks this is unacceptable, if it were to break it would be on me due to a poor design.  And I am not the only one who had problems like this, I have read of others with the same issue.Needless to say I took it back, it's not a horrible unit but for the price there are better answers."}, {"title": "Excellent, but pricey.", "review_text": "The receiver has a large touchscreen and is by far the easiest to operate and see while driving.

I used to use MapQuest to print-out driving directions, but I don't feel safe navigating from a paper print-out while driving.Upon browsing GPS at Fry's Electronics, this unit stood out among the rest as being superior.  I figured out the operation of the unit within minutes.If you select an option and do nothing, a pleasant female voice instructs you at to the options and purpose of the current screen.

The Grundig (now Eton) FR-200 is a small \"auxiliary\" AM-FM portable which adds general shortwave radio coverage, an LED flashlight, and a three-way power design that allows for a quick \"pick-me-up\" to a replaceable and inexpensive rechargeable NiMH battery pack similar to one used in the typical cordless phone.  A few minutes of cranking, `n you're back in broadcast business.  With these options, it's virtually impossible for this radio to not find \"juice\".  The FR-200 is imported by Eton from Tecsun in mainland China, and is marketed exclusively as an \"emergency radio\"...but I'm thinking--\"perfect for the canoe and camping trip\" where one wouldn't wish to lose something more costly to the elements.The reviews on this product have run the course--from favorable--to horrible.  This would clearly indicate either a serious quality control problem...a lack of reviewer perspective on just WHAT objective this product was designed to meet...or both.  After pondering this unique little $40 radio for over two years, I finally unwrapped and evaluated one (the package exterior said \"yellow\"--a neon-orange model waited inside).  The FR-200 is less than HALF THE COST of its most-similar alternative--the Freeplay Summit (which I have ordered--and twice returned because of substandard performance), so I was somewhat skeptical of this product format.  Upon closer examination and use, the less-expensive Grundig (while not brimming with \"digital glitz\" and rows of small silver buttons) is higher in overall performance, easier to pack and carry, and much more \"disposable\" should that situation arise.  My prior skepticism has turned into consumer gratification.  This product is satisfying, useful, and an unquestionable value.  Here are my performance observations...AUDIO QUALITY:  The sound of the FR-200 is crisp, clear, and natural.  While far from \"room shaking\"--this unit is fine as a close-in companion; and more-than-adequate for its intended purpose as a standby \"blackout radio\", or convenient portable \"sidekick\" at home, in camp, or out on the water.RECEPTION ON FM:  The worst goes first...The FM capabilities of the FR-200 are sad to barely acceptable, depending on your listening location.  In a small community, ANY nearby local station with brawny signal strength will overload the circuits in this radio to a point that renders it nearly useless--unless you enjoy the offending local station, which will populate itself on nearly the entire FM dial--crowding out even not-so-distant stations from out-of-town.  In an urban area, with many powerful \"close-in\" signals, the FM band becomes a jumbled and distorted mess where \"ONLY the strong survive\"--but barely!  Interestingly, out in fringe areas, where brutish FM signals are few and far in-between, the band shows signs of intelligible life...a plus for rural listening!RECEPTION ON AM:  Other than a few expensive \"AM niche\" and world-band receivers, the FR-200 is possibly one of THE BEST portable AM radios you can own!  Sensitivity, selectivity (in the absence of a strong local station), and recovered audio quality are OUTSTANDING!  NEVER have I seen a radio in this class (and several other classes for that matter) that provides as rich an AM listening experience.  During the daytime, even very distant AM signals are intelligible and less-assailed by the all-to-familiar \"circuit noise\" that hinders weak AM station listening on most radios.  Sensitivity remains consistent from the low (530 kHz) to the high (1700 kHz) end of the band--NOT typical for an AM receiver section in a radio at this price point.  Right \"out of the box\" my FR-200 easily caught, and faithfully reproduced in early afternoon, six AM stations from Chicago--over 250 miles from my location.  At night, this radio becomes a pint-sized DX-delight.  Virtually EVERY channel is \"alive\", yet moderate-to-strong signals remain \"separated\" and fully intelligible.  In the rare occasion that you may find, and choose to listen to, an AM station with a music format--you will find a hint of \"hi-fi\" in the reproduced audio.  This level of AM performance is usually the domain of the \"CC Radios\" of the market; and at less than one-quarter of their cost--the FR-200 is an \"AM standout\".  Here's another possible application: Your FR-200's headphone jack + a patch cord + the line input on your surround-sound = FAR BETTER AM reception and audio on that system.RECEPTION ON SHORT WAVE:  Plainly put--it is \"pedestrian\" at best.

Another great feature which is lacking on many other computer speakers is the headphone jack which is placed right in front of the speaker next to the volume and tone knobs.

I wanted something that runs reams around my Mac Mini's built-in speaker, or even the speaker built into my Westinghouse 17\" monitor. The Altec Lansing VS2220 fits the bill.I purposely stayed away from units with a subwoofer, because after all, I do live in an apartment and have to be as considerate of my neighbors as I expect them to be of me. As I write this, I'm listening to my favorite Supremes song on iTunes, \"Nothing But Heartaches\", and for those familiar with the wonderful Funk Brothers backup group that exemplified the early Motown sound, the alto sax is well-separated and evident on the right speaker. However, even with iTunes' equalizer set to Bass Booster, James Jamerson's ubiquitous strong bass line is muffled and subdued somewhat. Well, I've got wonderful headphones if I want to listen to him full bore without disturbing the neighbors.Until I finally move into a house, this will do for now! All I need now is a way to listen to the radio with the computer without being online (using dial-up; perhaps with Griffin's RadioShark).

I bought one extension & it's been OK.   The 5.8 gig size provides plenty of coverage throughout my tiny house.  The one thing that doesn't work well for me is the Toll Saver feature when calling to check messages - it may be the phone or it may be related to VONAGE, but I had to set it to five rings for checking messages. It would be nicer to have Toll Saver work properly, but otherwise the thing works well.  I don't fax a lot but the few occasions I do, it's fairly OK - again, any problems I have may be related more to the VONAGE/phone interface"}, {"title": "Almost Perfected!!", "review_text": "Sometimes manufacturer's get it right.  This product is no exception.  All of the features work as advertised.  It is economical with it's use of the \"printing film\" (for copies and faxes).  Of course, the more you fax and copy, the sooner it will run out.I've purchased 4 additional \"remote hand sets\" (Quantity:2 of KXTGA520M and quantity:2 of KXTGA523M).  I also purchased the Headset KXTCA92) as well for my office.I've owned this system for 10 months and everything works flawlessly!  Calls are crystal clear; Conference works great; it stores over 30 \"missed\" calls (I usually delete them when there is that many).  I've only replaced the replaceable film once.  I'd say that I fax and copy maybe twice a week.  The battery life on all of the phones is excellent.  I've had conference calls lasting up to 5 hours (thank god for the headset) and the battery still listed 3 full bars after I hung up.There is a nice backlight to see who's calling.  There is also a nice female digital voice that reads off who is calling when the phone rings. This feature may seem trivial, but it works at every handset throughout the house so you don't have to be near the \"main terminal\" to hear it.  If the caller does not allow caller ID, but allow their call number to display, the female voice says \"number available\" but does not read the number.  If their \"name\" comes up, it will read the name and gets it pronounced correctly about 85% of the time.  For example, a phone call from \"Dan & Angela Dickens\" is pronounced correctly but a call from \"UNICOM\" is pronounced \"u-ni-come\" instead of U-NI-COM.Here's the one drawback: When someone like a telemarketer calls and you see that it's from an \"888\" number, you can hit the \"off\" button which stops that particular phone from ringing any further.  However, it does not stop ALL of the other phones from continuing to ring.  As I said, I purchased 4 other handsets scattered throughout the house so you can hear the other phones ringing after you hit the \"off\" button.  A minor annoyance I've found to be a small mark on the overall feature set.The distance allowed from the \"main terminal\" is also excellent.  I've been on conference calls and walked to my mailbox outside which is about 700 feet away with no loss or degredation of signal.  I am not sure what the manufacturer specifications are but I believe that is plenty for just about any household or small office.To summarize, I've owned 3 of these types of \"all in one\" phone systems over the past 10 years and this model (and it's accessories) are top notch!

Sound quality has always been good with iPods but I clearly hear (coming from a 4 Generation unit) that the sound is even better. Apple has done great work on this and, combined with their newly designed (and much more comfortable!)  headphones, it's as pleasant as ever. At home I plug my iPod into a separate headphone amp and use expensive full-size headphones and, believe me, I can tell the difference between these two generations. Sound was very good before and is even better now.The new iTunes 7.0 software is excellent. Gapless music playback is a wonderful addition! No more \"dead space\" between tracks that were meant to be played smoothly from one to the other. There's also various album cover art views, free album cover art from the iTunes store, integrated control of your iPod, and an even easier way to control what is synched (or not synched) to your iPod. An easy to use product is now even easier to use. It's the perfect compliment to the iPod.And what a great value these iPods are! Two months ago you'd pay $300 for the 30GB model and $400 for a 60GB. Now they're each $50 less and yet they have much brighter screens, gapless music playback, the new headphones, 75% longer battery life, and software searching with the wheel to easily find any track/artist/album.

I modified it as described in the websites that describe how to do such things, but the sound is so crappy, that it's hardly worth the price.

Near FM quality sound, decent range (about 40 feet).  It only broadcasts on one of 6 channels, but at least the quality is acceptable if you can find an open one, and it punches through weak stations so the channel doesn't really have to be completely clear.

Here is the verdict based on my usage in Bay Area, California.Well, I do hear lots of static just like people here who gave 1 or 2 stars in Amazon review no matter how I tune it to different frequency or FM channels. BUT... there is one easy way to make the Tunecast works the way it suppose to be and it is very easy.Then I got back home and google the subject of \"modify TuneCast II\" and I found out some people has already found a way to improve the transmitter by adding a piece of speaker wire.Well, instead of buying a new speaker wire which cost maybe another 5~10 bucks, I just decided to try out with my old mobile earplug. I cut out the earplug's connector and carefully remove the plastic shield to reveal the copper wires for approximately 1~2 inches then taped that copper metal wire into the TuneCast circuit board. Please follow the jiggybyte instruction. It is the first search result if you google \"modify TuneCast II\"The bottom line: Do not buy this product if you are not willing to mod this tunecast because its original antenna is very weak for transmitting the signals.

It looks and functions identical except for the brand name, and it was only $20.  I figured it was so cheap I could just use it for the rest of trip and then forget about it.  To my surpise, the quality was much better that I remembered.  Maybe HP insisted on better quality control or something.Other advice:  Use the 12V DC adapter.

I played with Itunes for a week and confirmed, that an Ipod wasn't for me.  I went to Amazon to see what Creative had that was comparable to the Nano.  I found the Zen V Plus.I found it to be very versitile it did the things I do with a Mini Disc player but smaller and video.  I don't like Sony's DRM so I rip in WMA. The fact that I could transfer 10x faster  than Sony Mp3 player or Mini Disc and drop and drag kept me from returning it.  The sound is tailorable but not great; but still very good for a Mp3 player. The video sucks; with my Palm pilot video files compress to small file sizes for playback not so with the Zen it uncompress so a file that takes up 75MB on a Palm pilot takes up 450MB on the Zen. In short not for video and the screen is pretty darn small.  I will agree with other reviews on the plus and will not mention them so not to be redunant but I will point the the navigation/Music Mangement could be better.  Findings songs can take some time if you have alot of songs on the Zen.  If you want to listen to a group/artist/album that is all you listen to.  Unlike other players once the album/group is over it will switch to another group/album, not so with the Zen.  This something that could be improved on.  For the most part the Zen V is very small and doesn't scratch or ding up like pervious players I own.  As a Electrician and the player doesn't get in my way when I work.  I still haven't got use to the 14-16 hour battery life and the 6 hour charge time.  Sony devices charge within 2-3 hours and last for 25-50 hours on a single charge.  The Zen in short is a hassle-free device and would highly recomend this unit to anyone"}, {"title": "Small,sleek, not too cute, not too dull...", "review_text": "In summary why I picked Zen V Plus:-Good price/performance-FM radio and voice recorder-Small, scratch resistant and cool design-Drag and drop capability-Compability with different music stores-Very easy and quick navigation-Previous positive experienceIf you want a more detailed comparison to IPOD-Nano and Sandisk Sansa C200 series, continue reading and scroll down, if not stop here and get back to what you were doing, or want to do or whatever... :-)First off, this is my second Creative product in less than a year. No, no the old one is still good (ZEN Nano Plus) indeed the best one I've ever had, but I decided to go with something with color and a more navigation-friendly menu. I am not new to digital music.I've had a pleuthora of MP3 players within the last 5 years. Starting with a 32MB RCA (terrible), a 128MB Samsung (Good), a HD based Dell DJ(died on me,) two 6GB Apple Minis (one's Hard drive died, the other's click-wheel gave up), a Zen Nano Plus (excellent) and now this cool 4 GB Zen V-Plus. Before deciding on my new ZEN, I had two other serious considerations :1) IPOD NANO - 4GB or 6GB :Although I really loved the look and the price (not much above its competition)of the new IPOD NANO, I could not go with it because of previous (baaaad) experience and the required slavery to it's ITUNES software. It just is a pain in the neck when using my own MP3s (non i-tunes songs) and other music stores' products. Plus it did not have FM and voice recording, which are, I admit, pretty cool features.2)Sandisk Sansa C250 (4GB) or C270 (6GB):This was my clear favourite before actually going into a store and physically feeling it. Sandisk is the lead flash card memory manufacturer and its memories are really hi-Q.That and its clearly lowest price among peers made me consider this one more seriously. It had the voice recording and FM radio options and did not have the dreaded mandatory music software. Had even a bigger screen (1.8 inches) than Zen V Plus (1.5 inches). So why did Sandisk got eliminated? Easy:i)Extremely hard to use click-wheel, even if one has small hands (I don't,I am 6'2\" and 200lbs, so in my case a total \"forget it\"). The wheel is elevated from the surface very little, you accidentally hit other buttons while trying to operate.ii)Overall size and design. Sandisk looks like a fatter and less slick IPOD Nano. It does not have the different (shorter,squarer, more compact) feel of the Zen V Plus.Bottom line it is bigger and bulkier than both.iii)Icon based menu.That is a total no go for a small screen gadget. Just stick to line-based menu like all the previous and current IPods if your screen is less than 3 inches accross.So, cheaper, equipped with features like the Zen V Plus, with a bigger screen and comparable battery life, The Sandisk Sansa still got eliminated.After a month, what do I think about my Zen V Plus (4GB)?PROS:-Great size, look and feel.-Great, optional very easy to use Creative software.-100% Drag and drop compatible.-Vibrant colors.-Easy to navigate menu.-Easy to use joystick and buttons (except one, see below in CONS)-Decent battery life.-Great FM receiver.-PriceCONS-Hard to see the screen (OLED's curse) under direct sunlight.-Charging through USB (the only supplied cable) takes forever.-The placement of the \"back\" button. It should be on the left of the \"play/pause\" button not below. When the unit is in your palm unless you have a hyperextending thumb, it is hard to press this button - though possible.-Screen is not big enough for video viewing. Although video playback is seamless and vibrant, the size is just too small.Don't let the video capability a deciding factor if you are inclined."}, {"title": "Not Ready for Prime Time?", "review_text": "I bought the 2 GB model because the 4 GB version wasn't available yet and it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs. The 4 GB version is identical except for the amount of installed flash memory. This is the V Plus version, so it sports an FM tuner and the ability to display videos as a bonus.Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called \"firmware\") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the \"safe disconnect\" icon is often times not even in the system tray.If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk (\"ripping the songs\"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or \"podcasts\" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere"}, {"title": "DO NOT BUY THIS", "review_text": "I stubbornly ordered this product to use with my Treo 600 phone full well knowing that i was going to have to get the additional software driver from iGolf to make it work with palm os 5.

In fact, after reading reviews on Amazon about the new Inno and Helix, I've decided that those are not good enough to replace the MyFi just yet. Yes, they add new features, but some are lost as well.Anyway, I agree with all the good points and some of the bad points noted by the other reviewers. The main reason for my review is to point out something that I haven't seen discussed here, and that is that this radio needs to be warm to function properly. Maybe this is an isolated problem unique to me, but it seems that whenever the outside temperature drops below about 65 degrees, I can't leave this thing in the car for more than 15 minutes or so or else it takes a few minutes to warm up. This mostly happens if I'm playing back recorded content. It'll play for a few seconds, and then just freeze up. The only way out of it is to turn the radio off, and even then I have to turn it on and off 2 or 3 times (sometimes the display light doesn't work the first or second time). Like I said, this mainly only happens when playing \"MyXM\", but if it's really cold out, or if it's been in the car overnight, even the live XM doesn't work right away.I used to think it was solely the radio, but just recently I inserted my warm radio (brought from inside the house) into a cold car cradle, and I had the same issue for a minute or so.It's a minor glitch overall, but still annoying nonetheless.

Complicated setups (for example, I have my remote setup to switch to the DVD player and start playing a DVD--a process that involves my TV set, my receiver, and my DVD player) may be _a little_ tough for people who don't like setting up AV components, but EVERYONE will be able to use this remote as a simple replacement for the three or more remotes sitting on their coffee table.I've seen a lot of different universal remote controls, but this one is by far the best I've seen or used"}, {"title": "Incredibly powerful and flexible, but a bit complicated", "review_text": "Overall, I'm very happy with this remote, having tried several others over the years. But, it isn't without its flaws. First, the negatives:* The learning function, while robust, is often difficult because it is very sensitive to ambient light. Basically, if you have a florescent light on, there's almost not chance this thing will learn commands from another remote. Works fine in daylight, though.* I thought it was overly difficult to change the default device types on the main screen. If, for example, you don't want to use the VCR device on the main screen and change it to something else, you have to erase and relabel all the commands under it, rather than simply assigning it to a different device type.* The URC200 does not accept discreet device codes or advanced codes. The only options are if the code is in the pre-programmed library, or learning a function from another remote. Since I really wanted discreet power codes for my equipment as well as discreet input codes for my TV and A/V receiver, I had to first program these into an inexpensive One-For-All, then teach these commands to the URC200. Again, not a show-stopper, but a bit of a pain.* The transport keys (pause, play, FF, RW, etc...) are well-placed, but I would have really liked to have had both the FF and RW keys as well as the chapter skip ahead/back keys as \"hard\" buttons. Anyone with a DVR that supports the skip ahead/skip back buttons will tell you have handy this would be.Luckily, the good far outweighs the bad. On the plus side:* Apart from missing the 2 extra transport keys, the button layout on this remote is fantastic. Very logical layout, easy to navigate by feel. The button shapes also help in this regard.* The feel of the buttons is very solid. In fact, the whole remote feels very solid and well-made. Each button gives good tactile response when pressed.* The backlighting is very good, easy to see. The LCD screen is also very handy, easy to change labels.* This remote, in the right light, will learn anything. Some universal remotes have limited memory for learning, this remote learned a TON of buttons and never flinched.* Very flexible macro support, including the ability to add pauses between commands, and the ability to assign a macro to almost any hard/soft button.So, if you have some patience and a willingness to learn, this remote is a fantastic bargain. With some effort, it can be an activity-based remote, just like the more expensive Harmony remotes."}, {"title": "Great Remote!

I had 6 remotes cluttering my night stand and finally got frustrated enough to try and consolidate everything. This remote has preprogrammed codes as well as a learning function and editing features. This morning I taught it every feature of my Sony CD carousel and Harman Kardon audio/video receiver. I had already programmed the Phillips satellite receiver, Samsung DVD player and Sony TV. It even worked for my minidisc player!The text editing function is a bonus. I renamed all my inputs and some fuctions and added all the sound modes to the remote. HK receivers have Logic 7 and that was easily added. I can actually put the other 6 remotes away now. I even used the volume punch thru so that I can adjust the volume of the receiver from any function or input.

However, for 50 bones it still seemed to be a good deal, esp. if I could somehow overcome the Pioneer receiver issues.So my HT setup consists of a softmodded XBox running XBMC @ 720p for the DVD player, the before-mentioned Pioneer 816 receiver, a Sanyo PLV-Z4 projector, and finally, just for fun, an XBox 360. I also have various other audio/video equipment scattered throughout the house.So...the URC-200 controls all of them perfectly now, with the exception of the Pioneer receiver. Manually learning each key can be tedious, but it is the only way to go as the pre-programmed device layouts didn't make much sense to me. It took me a couple of hours to program all these devices, but once you get the hang of it, its very simple. The hardest part is figuring out how to best organize the page layouts for each device.Now, the Pioneer receiver was a different matter entirely. The pre-programmed codes turned it on & off as well as adjusting the volume, but that was about it. Manual learning only succeeded every 1 in 10 tries, and even then, only half the codes actually worked. I even resorted to using my PDA's IR port (with some remote control software) as a conduit between the Pioneer Remote and the URC-200. Again, I had only very limited success. 5 or 6 hours later, I was able to switch audio/video inputs with the URC-200 and switch an audio mode or two, just enough for casual use. I wasn't able to adequately operate the On-screen menu or adjust any of the advanced settings.What's strange is that some of the codes the URC-200 wasn't able to learn were already pre-programmed into the device and worked in operating the receiver, however I had wanted to move them to a different page. Unfortunately, moving items from page to page doesn't seem to be an option.My theory is that the URC-200's IR sensor is not able to \"learn\" certain IR codes, even if it is able to transmit them. And, since there's no PC interface there doesn't seem to be any way to get around it. So far, the only issues I have come across while researching this are the Pioneer receivers, but there may be more incompatibilities in the future. I think this is another reason for the lowered $50 price tag.Bottom line, this is a great remote for 99% of the equipment/people out there. And even though I was unable to achieve complete and total universal remote bliss with my receiver, I still end up using the URC-200 95% of the time.

After reading  numerous reviews, I selected the URC200...and purchased one to \"test the waters.\" While I've only had the unit for a few days now, within the first hour it easily surpassed my expectations. The remote is the perfect size/weight - it feels substantial without being too heavy. The buttons are awesome. For me, it strikes the perfect blend of \"full-featured\" and \"ease-of-use.\" Some of the other inexpensive HT remotes I viewed looked cramped with tons of buttons in a relatively small space. This unit is just right -- and guests seem to pick up its operation rather quickly.While it's true that there is some tedium to the programming, it really wasn't all that bad (think mobile phone SMS message typing)-- maybe 2 hours total for getting up to speed and programming all devices plus macros...and it only really needs to happen once. A computer interface would be nice, but I wasn't ever actually frustrated with the programming and it would likely have taken me extra time to install and configure any PC software anyway. Now I no longer need to \"reaquaint\" myself with the locations of the oft-used \"skip/jump\" and \"replay\" buttons whenever I switch between devices as equivalent functions now reside on the same programmable buttons for both devices.For folks with modulator systems, the macros rock since you can program the device buttons to also act as macros. In my case, if you hold down the \"TiVo\" button for 1.5sec (user-programmable delay) it will change the TV to channel 125 (the \"TiVo\" channel in my house) and change the remote to the appropriate device. Ditto with the other shared devices...no more having to remember which channel is which device!After reading the (rather sparse) manual, I've just ordered some INSTEON devices for lighting control and an X10 IR controller - which this remote contains pre-programmed codes for...so I look to using it to also control whole-home lighting.Bottom line is I'm thrilled with this controller and will be ordering 3 more once my renovations are complete"}, {"title": "so far so good", "review_text": "It's been in service now for over one month.

A recent concern of mp3 player users is the risk of loss of hearing because of prolonged exposure to loud volumes.  This is no concern for users of these headphones, because you get a clearer sound at a lower volume by not having to fight background noise with louder volumes.

In short, nothing works.  The products are incompatible.  Here are details:First, the range expander:  After an hour on the phone with Linksys customer service, I was told the range expander is compatible only up to version 4 of the router.  I had purchased a brand new version 5, meaning I needed to DOWNGRADE the router in order to use the range expander.  Customer service told me to return the new router, gave me a barcode number for the old version 4 router, told me to search local stores by reading barcodes on each box I could find, and good luck...I might, just might, get lucky.(Note:  I have version 1 of the range extender, which does NOT have an Ethernet jack.  Version 2 apparently does, located right below the antenna on the front panel.  Good luck trying to figure this out on your own...the box claims compatability with the router)Second, the webcam.  Here is the letter I just sent to Linksys:To Whom It May Concern,I want to formally complain about my customer service/technical support experience with Linksys.I bought a WRT54G Linksys router and a WVC54G Linksys Internet Video Camera with SoloLink DDNS service.  The SoloLink domain name fails to show the webcam image.  Instead, it brings up my router's web utility.Yesterday, I spent close to three hours on the phone with various technical support and customer service people.  The last step:  a 2PM follow-up support call was scheduled for today, in which I was promised the problem would be addressed.  No one has called me.I just called Linksys support again.  After another 30 minutes on hold, I was given another promise that someone will call me \"at some indeterminate point in the future.\"This \"service\" is unacceptable.This has been the single worst customer service/technical support experience I have ever had.  I have wasted many hours, most of it on hold listening to the same annoying song.  I have been accidentally disconnected TWICE, once yesterday and once today, forcing me to call back and wait on hold until another support person became available.  Worst of all, the appointment for 2PM today was not kept, and I had to reschedule business appointments to accomodate Linksys.I have been very polite with all of the support people.  I understand that this is not their fault.  This is Linksys's fault for building a support service that is unequipped to handle seemingly simple problems like mine.I will be sharing my experiences with Linksys support with my friends and with online customer review sites like amazon.com.

However, as an everyday cycling computer this unit is simply terrible.  The speed is erratic (if you're going 12 miles an hour it'll say 10.5, 14, 11.5 and so on).  The elevation is even worse.  When standing still in my backyard it would range from 105 feet to 210 feet.  On a five hour ride (that was hilly but not terribly hilly) it said that my elevation gain was 30,000 feet (or the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest).  The overall distance is inaccurate.  On a ride i have mapped out and I know is 20 miles the distance shows I travel 17.5 miles one day and 22 miles the next.

I also didn't want to spend very much or buy those huge 'phones that make you look like you came from space. Given my priorities I am sure that I got the best product I could. It's not perfect, but it is really good. Here's how I'd break down my review:Sound quality: 5/5. I am no audio expert, but I know that I am hearing nuances with these headphones that I never got on my old 'phones or the Bose speakers I got to plug into my laptop. Things sound crisp, clear, and just plain nice. I had high expectations for these, and they easily exceded them.Sound blocking: 4/5. In my house, awesome--what roommates? :) Out running near heavy traffic or on the subway, not so great. When I am in a loud situation I can still hear enough outside noise that it sometimes makes it hard for me to follow the music, which is too bad. However, it's not always a problem. Maybe I am not always getting a good seal? Maybe they block some sounds better than others? At any rate, I also listen to my music quite quietly to spare my hearing, so I don't feel like I can completely blame the headphones.Size and portability: 5/5. I heard these things were small, but I just didn't get it. They are actually smaller than the headphones that came with my old Walkman! I really like that they give me good sound without those huge cans I associate with noise-blockers. Also, in defense of the carrying case, people keep saying it gave them a ton of trouble, but I got them into it in one try. It took maybe twenty seconds. I actually considered not buying these because of all the complaints about the case, but I'm glad I didn't listen--I love the case and I use it every time I take these somewhere.Price: 5/5. These were the cheapest headphones I looked at, and overall I am so pleased with them. Watch for sales--I got them for way lower than the market price through a merchant on Amazon.Overall, I highly recommend these to anybody who wants a good, small, cheap pair of headphones.

So i went to Bestbuy, plunked down $150.00 & came home very excited.  I installed the software (no problem there, install went smooth), then i connected the WebCam, & adjusted the settings (piece of cake).  i then did a test for still pictures, & then a test of the video function & was amazed at the picture quality & the video sound & picture quality.  i played with various settings for a while & fell in love with this gadget.. & THEN I TRIED TO GO ON-LINE WITH IT.. & there folks was where the problem lies.. After you have installed the software, you are disabled from connecting to the internet. (WHAT!!!.. THAT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE RIGHT?? ... Yes it does).  i spent all day today trying to find a solution, thinking that i had done something wrong.  i cleaned out my computer & restored everything, got my on-line connection back... then carefully & meticulously tried to by-pass the problem by again making sure to turn off my pop-up blocker, i updated Logitech drivers, & a few other things.  i then reinstalled the Ultra Visions software, & connected the WebCam again.. POW!!! SAME PROBLEM.. NO INTERNET CONNECTION.  you get a message in bold font that reads \"The page cannot be displayed\" (\"cannot Find Server\") as if your modem is not connected.. i tried calling up Bestbuy & speaking with their \"Geek Support\" & everything they suggested i had already tried.. they wanted to make an appointment to send out their Geek Team (which would have cost me the same amount as the WebCam).  i said \"no\".  Then i went about the tedious task of Re-restoring the guts but into my computer, i went on-line to Logitech website, & found that i wasn't out of my mind, this problem is a common occurance with this product. their website states \"The cause of this issue is because the Winsock file of Windows is crashing or corrupt\" & there are a host of fix-it solutions, but they are insane (for one of the solutions you need to have an additional computer to to go on-line & save files to transfer to the computer with the corrupted internet connection. i only have 1 computer in my home).  i went back to my search engine & typed in \"Logitech Inc.  can't connect to internet\"  & a whole slew of others with the same problem came up... i'm bringing this gadget back to Bestbuy.. & getting my money back.  i wish one of the other reviewers would have listed this little flaw.. i would have loved for this thing to work, as the picture quality & sound are excellent (before you try to go on-line with it). but if you have my experience (& those of the others i read about on-line) you will feel it really does defeat the purpose of getting a WebCam.

Best on the market.", "review_text": "Logitech promises vastly improved image quality in this webcam because of its new lens, which is all glass. They aren't kdding. The image quality is superb, approaching that of Hi-8 videotape up to 960 x 720 video resolution and the interpolated 4 Megapixel still image size of 2304 x 1708 pixels.Installation of the Logitech QuickCam 10 software is simpler than earlier versions, with a much cleaner interface. My tests were conducted on a laptop running a Pentium M 1.6 Ghz CPU. Logitech suggests a Pentium 4 at 1.4 Ghz as a minimum, 2.4 Ghz recommended. They aren't kidding. The Pentium M 1.6 Ghz is somewhat underpowered and recorded video is a tad jerky, though Logitech's software does a commendable job of \"tweening,\" making the jumpiness far less annoying than it might otherwise be. I must stress that this is a limitation of the computer I used for testing, not the Logitech UltraVision.The visual resolution of this camera is simply stunning.If you're grandparent using a webcam to stay in touch with your grandchildren, get one of these today and send it to the kids: every little dribble of leftover jam on the little tyke's face will be beautifully visible - as will the radiance of their smiles. (Can you tell I'm a big, big fan of using webcams to stay close to grandchildren?) Marketing and sales reps will appreciate the clarity of the image. Be forewarned because Logitech doesn't seem to tell you this: minimum focusing distance appears to be about one foot. Everyday webcammers best be prepared to hear oohs and aaahs from others. Great visual resolution and the video, even on an underpowered machine, is exellent.The new lens alone is worth the price and makes the Logitech UltraVision a must-have for any serious webcammer. Field-of-view, incidentally, is excellent: not too narrow, not too broad at default settings. Moderate use of the digital zoom will give you precisely what you need.But there's lots more. The noise-cancelling microphone is truly excellent. You don't need a headset ever again. In tests without any background noice, the audio was crisp and clear. In my tests, there was no hint of echo or the dreaded \"down in the well\" quality. Really cool! In another test, I turned the television up in the background. Still excellent noise-cancelling characteristics. This is a second solid reason to buy the UltraVision.The Logitech RightLight feature does a good job of optimizing low-light  or unbalanced light conditions.The digital zoom is very noisy at higher magnification. A keyboard shortcut for implementing the digital zoom would be helpful for those moments when you feel like playing.The Logitech FaceTracking feature works which is about all I can really say about it. It's not a feature I really make use of.The Logitech software has a new and much cleaner interface. The (in my opinion) stupid avatars are still with us. Kids might like them, but I have no use for them. The control panel as a whole is more accessible than in the past.The UltraVision camera itself is a nice piece of design. It is surprisingly bigger than the product illustrations convey. The tapered cylindicral design is, to my eyes, more pleasing than Logitech's classic orb design. The simplified mount is more adaptable to laptop screens. Overall, do not consider this as a webcam to travel with. It's bigger than most people would want to carry in their briefcase or computer tote.Overall, this is probably the very best webcam Logitech has ever produced. The visual quality is heads and shoulders above anything else in the webcam market. Absolute stunning. The noise-cancelling microphone is vastly improved and means you'll never need a headset again. A great package and well worth the premium price.Jerr"}, {"title": "Monster Cable: it's Sexy!

First I ran a movie, medium sound volume, on my ipod alone with it fully charged. It lasted 137 minutes (2 hours, 17 min.). Then I *fully* recharged the ipod and plugged it into the TuneJuice with a brand new 9v. On the same set of movies, it lasted 202 minutes (3 hours, 22 minutes). So you'd get about an hour of extra power. Not bad for the price.However, there are some things to consider. This is a one shot deal: when the ipod battery runs out, you will not be able to use the TuneJuice to recharge it. The 9v is not powerful enough to run the ipod by itself, and so the ipod will be draining both the TuneJuice and its own battery simultaneously. The ipod battery will drain faster than the 9v and run out before it.The next day, we tested the 9v we used and it was still good. So you will be able to use the same 9v more than once.So bottom line: in order to get the full use of the TuneJuice, you have to plug it in when the ipod battery is fully charged. Once the ipod's battery runs out, which it will, the TuneJuice is useless no matter how many 9v batteries you have with you or how charged they are.

I listen to the radio above ground and to podcasts and music below ground in the subway.  The E260 is great for both functions -- the FM radio reception is actually quite good, better than my Creative Micro and an older RCA Lyra.The reason that I gave it 4 stars is because the software on the player is missing some functionalities that SanDisk should fix in future Firmware upgrades.  First, it would be nice to return back to the song that you had been listening to before you switch to FM.  The player requires you to go back through the menu steps to find the song again.  It does save what you had chosen before, so all you have to do is press select over and over again.  If it remembers these choices, it would seem a logical step to put you back at the actual song again without the menu steps?  Second, the player is missing a bookmark capability.  This is a big issue if you want to use the player to listen to audio books.  Third, the fast forward only steps forward by 5 seconds or so each push of the fast forward or if you hold it down longer.

Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.Like many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it).It came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.It came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.Overall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod"}, {"title": "This product stinks", "review_text": "I dislike ipods so i figure I try something else and hope for the best..Unfortunately I was wrongItunes and Ipods are definitely much better..Basically this device is a cheap piece of crap and it seems like Sandisk's approach is WYSIWYG..disappointingPROS:- long battery life- email tech support is quick and good but website support sucks badCONS:- it's easy to setup but instruction manual is useless- buttons are rigid and miniature and difficult to press with a skin on- wheel is very stiff and offers very little functionality- software is buggy and terrible- freezes occasionally- navigating through menus stutters and lags- boot time is 10 seconds- video mode has no options- needs serious firmware updates- time is listed only in settings menu = useless- tons of issues with playlists getting erased or not working properly- every firmware update erases all your settings, including radio presetsand the list of issues goes on and on...anyone who has reviewed this product positively obviously didnt do a thorough job because these issues exist and its definitely irritatingI am extremely disappointed and will never buy a sandisk player ever againMy suggestion is to try it out thorougly before buying..so you dont make the same mistake I did and trust other people's lopsided reviews.."}, {"title": "OOOOH....Almost there", "review_text": "I have to say I was very pleased with the ease of interfacing and manuevering.

I've never been able to get the Sansa Media Converter to recognize my Sansa e250. Consequently, I've never been able to add pictures or videos to my player.  This is despite 7 sets of correspondences with their help desk.  Their most helpful suggestion was for me to try to sync to a different Windows XP machine.  Yeah, I'm going to buy a new PC because they can't figure out how to test their software before releasing it to the public.It's consistently had problems syncing to a playlist.  Most of the music that i've tried to sinc has gotten to my player, but not necessarily in the playlist that I set up.  Instead, in order to hear the songs on the device, I'd have to navigate to each indivual artist's folder and play those (1 - 4, on average) songs, and then go to some other folder when I was quickly sick of hearing the first small batch of songs.Now my player won't even boot up.  I've only had the thing for 2 months and I can't even get it to go past the splash screen.  What a total piece of garbage.I hate to say it, but I think I'm going to have to bite the bullet and go back to apple and buy another iPod.  What was I thinking?

I had it for about a month, and had never freezed.The latest firmware also has custom EQ, which sounds better than those presets, in my opinion. If you high the bass, however, it sounds very distorted. You can reduce that by lowering the second and third bars of the eq. Overall sound quality not very impressive(my other mp3 player, iriver u10, is way better). Still, acceptable and better than the nano's.When you convert videos on the Sandisk media converter, the sound quality is noticably reduced. A very bad thing when you are transfering music videos, but you can mod the program to solve that problem. Just search how by going to the e200 forums in the anythingbutipod website. Photos were easy, but I had to go in rotate all my photos so it will appear full screen on my Sansa. That's time consuming.I think that the mechanical wheel is better than the ipod touch. You can actually feel it scrolling, if you know what I mean. The bad thing is, after exessive use on the wheel, it becomes a little loose and chuggy.I personally have no problem pressing the buttons on the outer side of it(I have small fingers), but if you have thick fingertips, I understand that it will be a little difficult, especially when you have a case put on the player.This one time, I was scared to death when sound was only coming from one side of the headphones. I tried switching headphones, but the problem still remainded. Fortunatly, I was able to fix it by twisting the headphone plug around while it was in the input. I'm still a little wary that it might happen again.I once dropped my device pretty hard on the kitchen floor. Surprisingly, no damage was made externally and internally(still, be careful!)Overall, very good player. I definitly choose it over the ipod nano.I mean you get more battery life, a bigger(and brighter)screen, video playback, fm radio, voice recorder, USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, custom eq, expandable memory.. All in half the price. I wouldn't understand why some people would still choose to buy a nano. Because of those people, there are not a lot of accessories for the e2xx(yet).Update: My videos are starting to freeze. It plays for a few seconds, but then turns in to a white screen and the device reboots itslef. It happens very occasionaly though.Also, the player sometimes skips some of my songs.Not a real huge problem, but still, those are some glitches I found."}, {"title": "Photosmart an intelligent printing choice.", "review_text": "I bought this to replace my old beloved Canon PIXMA ip1500 after about two years of faithful use. In the end, the print head clogged up, and even after several alcohol soaks, I could not revive it. My Canon was a blessing as far as ink prices were concerned, and I wanted a good printer to replace it. I decided that I was going to step up and get a multifuction printer this time.I settled on this one after reading the reviews on Amazon. I am very pleased with my purchase. For starters, the printer looks amazing. It is very sleek, and it doesn't look like your typical office machine at all. It is very well designed, and everything fits together in a compact way. One thing that made me leap for joy with this printer was the ink cartridges. They are not as cheap as my beloved PIXMA ip1500 ink cartridges, but there is a reason for this. Older printers used to have a separate print head that the ink would fit into. That was great, but if the print head got clogged, you would be screwed (just as I was) because you either had to replace it, which would end up costing much more than the original price of the printer, or you would have to get another printer all together.With the Photosmart C3180 ink, the print head is actually built into the ink cartridge! That means that if the print head ever gets clogged, then you don't have to worry about getting another print head or another printer. You just have to get a new ink cartridge to replace the print head. That is amazing! The printer will last for that much longer.The ink is good as well. I get excellent print quality for what I use it for.  The controls are easy to use, and you can plug you memory card right into the unit and get great pictures directly from the card. The one touch controls are pretty straight forward if you ask me. The scanning and copying is good as well.If I have one issue with the printer, it is the tray. The printed pages have no where to go but on top of the unprinted ones. The tray was not desinged well to keep the printed pages separate from the ones being fed into the printer, but if you just be careful about watching what you print, then that is not an issue at all.I am very impressed with this printer. The more that I use it, the more impressed I become. I am satisfied with this, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powerful all-in-one printer at an exeptional price"}, {"title": "Elcellent For Scanning Old Slides", "review_text": "Wonderful for scanning old slides.

There are many aspects to these cables that make them worth the money other than whether they improve your signal or not.Here are some of the items that I was very impressed with:They have a tight net encasement around the cable so the cable easily glides through and around tight spaces.The cable feels like you would expect a cable to feel.  There are no thin, weak, or sub-standard parts to the cable that wear or break after repeated usage.The thumb-screws on the connectors are right-sized and easier to handle than most.Plus, all the other stuff that the others claim doesn't matter such as the gas-injected extra RF shielding, the gold connectors, etc.RF interference does affect a digital signal exactly the same way it affects an analog signal, but because it is digital, it doesn't matter as much how weak the signal so long as the message being sent hasn't been lost.  A weaker digital signal is still read correctly whereas a weaker analog signal might not.  However if a digital signal is distorted enough that the digital message has changed, it will result in distortions in the digital picture.  Depending upon the amount of interference you have, that is unlikely to occur but is possible.Bottom line is a cheaper cable will produce a just-as-good picture, but that has never been what Monster cables are about.  They are about being able to get top quality cable, preventing most problems that can arise from using cheaper ones.

These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don't get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they're just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables.Several people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there's really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you'd see between any other \"cheap\" versus \"designer\" cables on the market.But Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that's worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn't just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn't doubt if they're certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you're looking at the right cables.But for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections.

Media Center PC for music and DVD's3. Satellite Receiver4. Tivo Series 25. Sony DE-998 Receiver with multi-zone setup (patio and living room)Unfortunately after setting up the system, the 5 remotes they were faced with and myriad menu selections proved daunting.  While they wanted an advanced and flexible home theater system, neither one is a \"techie.\"  They found the system reconfiguration that was required when for example switching from watching Tivo to playing music with the media center overly complicated.  As a result the media center was barely used and certain features they had wanted, such as the 2nd zone in the patio, were never used at all.  Finally, when my parents visited they complained they couldn't figure out how to watch television.After doing some research I recommended this product.  I spent a Saturday setting up the remote and teaching everyone how to use it.  My sister was overjoyed at the ability to get her garden music playing with the touch of a button.  They have been much happier with their system now that all the features are easily accessible.  And for the ultimate test, my mother raves about how easy it is for her to sit down to watch movies and television.(Note unlike another reviewer I had no problems with the remote controlling the Tivo using the online setup...)Features on this remote that are particularly attractive are:- \"activity\" buttons that will seamlessly control multiple components simultaneously.  The activity concept is intuitive and well implemented.- memory of which components are on and which need to be turned off when switching activities- extremely large database of controllable componentsCons:- setup requires precision to enable everything to work properly (know the exact model of your components!).  Be prepared for a headache if you're not comfortable navigating through computer menus.- LCD screen is a bit small/low resolution- Battery life is limited; a rechargable stand would have been a plus- Ergonomics aren't as nice as some other Harmony remotes, such as the 550.  Some of the buttons are a bit cramped, if you need reading glasses have them handy when getting used to the remote.If I had to do this over again, I would probably recommend the Harmony 550 to my sister due to the superior ergonomics.

It is designed to be a cost effective solution for a transeiver-less [meaning no silly USB devices to plug in to use the mouse] optical bluetooth mouse. As with any bluetooth device, there may be an issue in communication with some bluetooth devices. The best way to fix this is to talk with the manufacturer of the notebook or transceiver and see about an update in software, firmware, or hardware.The first thing you will more than likely notice when holding this mouse is the way it fits your hand. It's not obsurdly small like some other notebook mice and it is no where near big. I've read where some reviews think the mouse is \"too tall\" to fit in their notebook cases. I personally find that may be true for the Mac notebook solutions but most other notebooks it will not be an issue. I own a Sony VAIO SZ-280P and the mouse is of the same thickness. It's designed to be confortable, so this means you need something to hold onto which it delivers that beautifully.The setup on my notebook [which actually uses a Toshiba Bluetooth module] was fast and easy. Once it was setup with the bluetooth manager [which took all of 2 minutes] I can now turn on and off the mouse at any point and the notebook will detect it automatically within about 4-5 seconds [this may vary due to the notebook's refresh rate (how often the computer looks for devices)of the bluetooth manager]. Some reviews have noted that the mouse sometimes needs a second to respond. This second delay is the mouse 'waking up' from a soft sleep. Which nullfies the comment from another review stating that this device needs an 'auto off' function. It has a soft sleep mode which allows it to conserve power, the Red LED stays on so that it can see if you are trying to use the mouse and then 'wake' it back up. This results in an always ready to use state, but incorperates an extremely energy efficient sleep mode that allows you to forget to turn this mouse off for days without killing the battery. I myself have left it on for days in my notebook bag and still have PLENTY of battery life. I have had this device for about 5 months and am still using the batteries that came in the device. I use the mouse maybe 2-3 hours in a normal day with many peaks of 5-8 hours. The great thing that goes unmentioned, if you find yourself with dead batteries and only one spare AA battery left, it will function with just ONE of the two AA Batteries in the mouse. I found this extremely smart for those JUST IN CASE situations when you don't have two batteries to complete the circuit.The mouse use is also very pleasent. I love the weight of the mouse myself [different for each person], as well as the sensativity, and overall functionality [yes forward and back buttons would be nice, but you can always switch to keyboard shortcuts]. I've not had the issue of the battery cover coming off at all except for a really bad fall or two. Never in use or storage.This mouse overall is GREAT.

I had truely wished I had bought a Creative Zen M Vision, however these headphones have brought new life to my 5G iPod, litteraly.My first experience with this headphone was ecstatic. I was dumbfounded and could not help but flip through all the music I could, on my iPod, to hear things I had not heard on an MP3 player before.I can hear nuiance in my music that had not been there before. There is a clarity and richness I have never heard before. I had simply taken it for granted that an MP3 file would not sound as good as a CD. The only draw back is Bass, which does not seem to be as deep as with a panasonic inner ear headphone, I had previous to this. Also, the Bass seems to distort at times, though I am not sure if this is because of a lackluster MP3 file or a defincency in the design (I am leaning toward blaming the MP3 file).The Bass issue does not bother me as much, I listen to Jazz, New Age, Pop, and Electronic Space Music. Within these genre I am \"taken care of\" with the distinct sound I get from the mid and upper range, and the Bass is sufficent in my space music to give depth perception.This purchase was made while salivating over a Creative Zen M, and resisting the urge to buy it, because I own an iPod.  In the display was a box containing these headphones and I bought them instead of dishing out more money for another MP3 Player. Now, my iPod has become an audio device, instead of a Podcast-TV show updater as it had been used previously.Amazon definately has the better price point and often when I make these impulse buys I sign on to Amazon to find a better price than I had paid.

Take your time and use the plug size that fits your ear best.  I used the medium plug and was disappointed with the sound.

If you have not used in ear phones before, give yourself some time to adapt.  The plugs that come with this unit are very soft and you should tolerate them well after a little familiarization.*Sound quality is very good.  I had to crank up my Zen Vision M with the phones I previously used.  With the Aurvanas I find a much lower volume is necessary.  Use your eqalizer to adjust these to your liking.  I prefer my music on the sweet side with lots of treble and medium bass.  These handle that very nicely.*Sound isolation is excellent, with almost all low frequency sounds completely disappearing. Engine hum, highway traffic, etc are practically gone.  The units will allow some high frequency sounds in, which is a plus if you are using these as a pedestrian and want to hear a car horn, ambulance, etc.*Appearance:  These are some good looking phones!  Pretty gloss on the driver units, attractive matte grey plugs.  The black is very cool and is a standout among all the masses of white corded sheep.*Case.  Nice case that fits easily in a a pocket, purse, etc. It's a little crowded in there if you throw in the cleaning tool.

They work great at home, in the car, and when I cut the grass. They also can produce a lot of sound on low sound settings saving me battery life on my mp3 player. The only thing that may affect wether you would want these or not is the fact that they are in ear.

Adding the same capacity in new CF cards would have cost 6-8 times as much, depending on the speeds involved. Better yet, the PNY adapter lets us take advantage of  the card format with the cheaper going $/MB ratio when it comes time to add capacity. (CF and SD seem to go back and forth in that regard.)Long version: Over the last few years, we've tried to stick with CompactFlash (CF) devices but somehow managed to pick up ~1.5 GB worth of SecureDigital (SD) cards along the way -- including a pair of 512 MB SDs purchased as Christmas stocking-stuffers for the kids' new MP3 players.So much for thinking you know what kids want. The players never caught on -- the kids still prefer CDs -- and those big SD cards gathered dust.Fast forward now to last week, when I finally got my hands on a new CF-only 8MP Canon 20D DLSR purchased, among other reasons, to capture an upcoming family trip.o The good news: The 20D's truly a pleasure to use, and the photos it takes are nothing short of stunning.o The bad news: It gobbles up 1 GB CF cards like so much popcorn, and the retooling costs -- new lenses, filters, dedicated flash, remote, batteries, car charger, monopod, yada, yada -- added up to a small fortune. \"You never told me it'd cost =that= much!\" Who knew? Well, I kinda knew... 8^JAt that point, I knew 2 more things for sure:1. My ~4 GB arsenal of CF cards would carry at most 80% of the trip.2. I'd be looking at some serious doghouse time if I had to pop for another GB or so of CF memory between now and then.What to do? Hmmm, if only I could make use of those SD cards...Enter the PNY SD-to-CF card adapter. Pop an SD card into the side of the adapter and use it as you would any other CF I card. It's as simple as that -- my camera and card readers never knew the difference. No drivers, no fuss. Better yet, read-write speeds don't seem to suffer.A previous reviewer complained about the side-loading, but to my mind, that's precisely beauty of the PNY design. A glance at an SD card sitting on top of a CF card should convince you that holding a top-loaded SD card =completely within= the CF I form factor just isn't feasible.Complete containment, of course, is what you want to insure the broadest possible CF compatibility.

An SD card fits right into this adapter, and this adapter is exactly the same dimensions as a Type I CF so it fits into ANY CF slot. It basically turns any SD card into a CF card. The only thing that keeps it from being perfect is the SD card slot is in the side. This means the adapter has to be removed from whatever device it is inserted in before you can swap the SD card.  Perfection would be if the SD card were inserted through the back edge of the adapter so the SD could be removed from the camera (or PDA, etc.) without removing the adapter itself.It is a little pricey, but there seems to be more SD deals these days, SD seems to be faster than CF (in my experience), plus if you carry around a lot of memory cards, there will be a weight savings using SD instead since they are so much smaller. Not to mention so many other devices use SD (PDA, MP3 players, etc.) so using this adapter, you can use the same cards in everything.

With the hundred dollar plus rebates on the hardware, as well as substantial discounts on the service, I thought I'd break down and give it a try.  Here' my experience...The Good...1. Very intuitive user interface for the set-up screens and remote; it could be argued that Tivo is the gold standard for ease of use2. Very secure packaging of unit3. Included cabling is of unusally high quality (not Monster cable grade, but still very good for included cabling)4. Installation directions are very easy to follow (though not as good as Dell's color coded design)5. There is a 30 day money back guarantee6. Customer reps are friendly and well trained (and they speak english too!)The Bad...1. The front of the box says all required cables are included; the directions state that a second A/V cable -- required for the recommended installation method -- is \"user provided\" (i.e., sold separately)2. The service is not compatible with some VoIP services3. Though set-up is easy, it is a one to two hour ordeal, requiring multiple visits to websites and countless button presses to ensure interoperablity with the cable box4. The remote is pretty low tech looking; it also has a lower quality feel tha leads me to belive that I'll be shopping for a replacement in a year or lessThe Ugly...1. They try to get you to sign up for a three year, pre-paid service contract; if after 30 days you find that you don't like/need Tivo, you forteit all that money -- ouch!2. When I attempted to use the website to activate the service, the site was unstable and wouldn't allow me to complete the order.  I then called the 800 number for service, where the hold time exceed 25 minutes.

During prime time I would often have to miss one show in order to record another, that problem is now solved.  Additionaly being able to watch something else while the tivo records just adds to the control you have over when you watch something.I now have the old tivo in my bedroom, connected wirelessly to the new one.  I'm able to watch something off of the dual tuner on the single tuner as its transfering, however it isn't fast enough to be able to fast forward more than a couple minutes, so you're going to get the commercials in that case.

I've actually purposely abused one to see how it held up and the only indication that it needs cleaned is the ball will take more efffort to move (but a very small differnce), but it still worked perfectly otherwise.

Unlike Dolby Surround, which is used on VHS tapes, TV broadcasts, and digital cable and encodes left, right, center, and ONE rear center speaker into stereo sound, true 5.1 (three speakers at the front, two at the back, and low frequency effects channel for the subwoofer) encoding requires a wider frequency range which is not supported by RCA audio connections. Therefore, either an optical or digital coax cable must be used.  A digital cable is just a light guide. Shielding or frequency response, important for video cables, are not much of an issue here. Therefore, an expensive optical cable will work just the same as a cheap one, unless the cable is defective. Keep in mind, however, that in order to get 5.1 surround to work, you may have not only to hook up the digital cable, but also (1) check the settings of your DVD player / game console to make sure that optical output is enabled, and 5.1 surround signal is not downmixed to standard stereo (consult your DVD player manual), and (2) that the optical input of the reciever is used when you choose the DVD player as input. Most DVD players also have a digital coaxial output, which works exactly the same for 5.1 surround as optical output.

I've been really pleased with this unit and its pretty incredible array of features.I will concur that the plastic on the unit is not the most-durable feeling material, but it's certainly sufficient. Plus it comes with a nice little nylon case to protect it and carry it, so that more than makes up for it.First, the quality of the TV and AM reception is superb. I love talk radio, but hate the constant fade in/out. This unit does much better than any radio I have -- a couple of which are pretty expensive -- on picking up weak signals.The sound quality also is good for the size of the unit. Clear, good quality sound that's easy to hear and not tinny.The plastic is lightweight, which doesn't feel so great, but it does make the unit easy to carry. And a minute of cranking generates plenty of listening time. The three-LED light array is plenty bright and a great little area light in case of emergency. The variety of power sources make this a no-brainer for emergency use -- cranking, built-in rechargeables, alkaline or lithium AAs or a power adapter, if you want to buy one.Here's what I found best though. I use a Palm Treo, so the unit didn't come with a charging tip that would fit it. I contacted the company, Eton, by e-mail to inquire if I could purchase one somewhere. Within a few hours, they responded to say that not only was there now a Palm tip available, they would provide me one at no cost.

It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk 256MB CompactFlash Card, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs"}, {"title": "P.O.S.", "review_text": "Okay, I just bought one of these.

The volume in the speaker was adequate, if not quite as loud as I would like. Our clients had no problems understanding us and we had difficulty only when they spoke softly. We used a camera installed in the laptop to which we attached this speakerphone and found the video to be helpful with these new clients whom we had never met in person. The confidentiality of our communication was assured because SKYPE employs 256-bit encryption that cannot practically be broken. Because this was all computer-to-computer, there was no cost associated with these hour-long calls beyond our normal monthly payment to the DSL provider.

I checked several forums, websites, and read through many postings (Amazon included) to figure this out.As others have noted, the base map in Vista Cx is pretty limited.  Since my goal was to get a GPS device for hiking, mountain biking, and driving directions when I travel, this was the logical upgrade for the Vista Cx.  If you are seeking turn-by-turn directions for a Vista Cx, then this is a must have.Here are my likes:1) The directions are pretty good.  I tried out several routes that I take on a daily basis and the directions followed my usual way.  There are times when the software (both on the computer and on GPS) favors the shortest routes over shortest time (e.g. streets vs highways).  However, you can also refine the routes by selecting intermediary points and letting the software recalculate.2) Extensive list of POIs.  This information is very broad and covers many things (maybe a little too much, see dislikes).  Most of the POIs are current.  Definitely very useful when I was driving up I5 from LA to SF and needed to know food options at upcoming exits.  Some of the POI data is limited, for example, I had a tough time finding one particular store because it was buried amongst other stores in a large shopping mall.  I haven't researched ways to update the POIs, but Garmin provides a utility to create your own icons and POIs (xImage).3) Very detailed street data.  Version 8 is quite current, it even has many of the new roads that have been built in the last 2 years around north Las Vegas.  Don't expect it to be perfect, I definitely found roads that probably should been mapped (even in the highest detail setting they were not visible), but for its breadth, the street data is very good.4) On the fly recalculation of route.  This may be attributed to the Vista Cx and City Navigator combined, but I was very impressed when I missed a turn and the directions were recalculated.5) Tech support.  I called tech support because I couldn't figure out how to unlock the software (too many options for unlocking).  He was very helpful and walked me through the whole process.  He also stayed on the line to give me a quick tutorial for using the software.  Lastly, he wasn't one of those typical CSRs that reads from a script or needed to look things up, he really knew the products and how they work.My dislikes:1) Too many POIs, Do I really need to see all the nail salons within 3 miles of my house?  Really. The POIs is so extensive, it has businesses that you don't really care about.  It would be nice if Garmin provided a feature where you could select which POI categories to download from the map into the GPS.2) The price.  This software is very expensive, but if you consider the versatility in getting navigation and something small enough for hiking and a combined price that is less than an auto navigation unit, then this is pretty good.  For comparison sake, Magellan is coming out with a new unit that can be used for both auto navigation and hiking, but its MSRP is still more than the combined price of a Vista Cx with this software.3) Updates to the software.  This is where I think Garmin can change their approach.  The upgrade price for v7 to v8 is $75.  That is a lot of money and not something I wish to spend to go from v8 to v9.  I'm hoping there won't be reason to, but we won't know until that time comes.Recommended upgrades:1) Definitely get a bigger memory chip.  If you can reduce some of the POI info, this may not be as critical.  However, I was only able to fit So Cal on a 64MB chip.2) Check Garmin website for software patches.  I ran into a few issues when I installed Topo after CN.  I needed some patches from Garmin to get this resolved.  Not a big deal because I got a very helpful pop-up screen from Garmin about the patch just before Mapsource crashed.I've had my GPS and CN for a couple weeks now.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with it.

In any case, I'm getting the car-charger option and a couple extra batteries for longer rides.I didn't like all the wires I had to rig up to use with the helmet kit, but considering the price compared to some of the other motorcycle-to-motorcycle set-ups, it's worth the savings. The weather channels are a bonus.My recommendation is that if you're just looking for walkie talkies, you can find some good ones for a lower price.

The sound is clear and the bass is not distorted-the subwoofer really integrates with the 4 satellites.3) Wall brackets-Included for rear satellites.CONS1) Surround speakers-Though the power output is supposed to turn up to the same as the front speakers, the rear speakers seam quieter. If they are too far away it is easy to not hear them at all unless you adjust them louder in surround-sound card software.2) Bass-No separate volume control; must use surround-sound card software or media player equalizers.3) Volume-Due to low power, don't expect this too get super-loud, but I find them plenty loud while watching movies.OVERALLFor the price, you really can't beat these speakers. They are great for me for now, though I foresee trading them in for a more powerful 5.1 system some time down the road to complement my external 5.1 sound card on my laptop. For a tight budget and a small room, this system is worth its low price.Unless you have or plan on getting a good 5.1 sound card (and DVD-playing software that can decode 5.1), there is little need for more than a 2.1 system.

The concept of a portable PDA keyboard wasn't invented by Think Outside, but they were the ones who perfected it. This model, which I use with a Zire 72, does its job well. Here are a few other things you might want to know:1. Folding in half, it's only slightly thinner than the models that fold into four sections. It makes up most of the difference by omittng the top row of keys; the numerics are combined with the top alphabetical row. On balance, having a condensed keyboard works quite well. However, the space bar is split in half, and the center seam gets in the way of key input sometimes.2. Unlke previous Think Outside keyboards, which were made of a thin metal casing and plastic keys, this model is mostly plastic. It's well-made, even if it lacks its predecessor's feel of sturdiness. One is advised to open and close the unit with reasonable care, and it will probably last a long time.3. Personally, I keep my Zire 72 in a folding metal case - which doesn't quite fit under the clip that would otherwise hold the PDA in place during use. The good news is that you can rest the unit's metal case on the keyboard's metal bar and still get excellent IR reception without removing it from its case all the time.4. If your PDA already has keyboard software installed, you may have to uninstall it. Since the Palm system will not let you delete it, you'll need to download a utility from the Think Outside website. Only then can users install the correct software. (Of course, this may not be the case with all PDAs.) This difficulty took nearly a week of on-and-off effort to resolve. Fully read the instructions on their website to avoid this problem.5. Once installed with the antenna properly alighned (just under the IR port), the keyboard is fast, responsive, and a pleasure to use. Having IR is an advantage over Bluetooth, since it's more stingy with power, and has no wireless delays.6. Lightness is a great advantage. My personal \"kit\" includes my PDA encased in aluminum, the keyboard, a portable plug, and a leather pack - all totalling 18 ounces. When you consider that most mobile computing involves text editing, this keyboard is a no-brainer. I wouldn't think of getting a PDA without one."}, {"title": "Think Outside Stowaway Wireless Keyboard", "review_text": "You can carry this in your pocket, take it anywhere.

For starters, like many others, I had trouble with the strange latch on the battery compartment.  Even though I had been warned by other reviewers, I broke the latch trying to get it open.  Amazon accepted an exchange without question, and I'm very grateful.  The next time, having experimented with the broken one, I was able to get this one open, and connected the rechargable power supply.  Hopefully, if I ever have need of the radio in a real emergency, I won't break the latch in attempting to open it.Other design considerations:  I might have recessed the buttons, or maybe built a more rugged frame, if I was designing it.  But then, I might have priced it out of the market doing so.My purpose is that this radio goes in a kit of supplies in case of an emergency-earthquake, tornado, flood, etc. (ask FEMA for a great manual, or see if your local fire dept offers a CERT program-Community Emergency Response Training).

The player can send 720p or 1080i signal to the TV. (Current DVDs are 480p; that standard will change eventually with Blu-Ray and HD-DVD.)

I had never heard that Kingston was considered an offbrand, but I decided to experiment using another manufacturer's SD card.  I inserted a SanDisk SD card, and the camera worked beautifully.  Perhaps SanDisk adheres more closely to guidelines for cross-compatibility between digital devices, but that was a lesson for me.Contrary to the experiences of some, I have never had problems with a SanDisk memory card - CF or SD - whereas this is the second time I've had problems with a Kingston memory card - one time it was a 512MB CF card that suddenly went belly-up after not much use, and now their 256MB SD card was having compatibity issues.

If this is how they treat would be paying customers then you can only guess how they will treat you if, for instance, you want a repair. This is a company that one should STEER CLEAR OF.

When it does work it is ok, but one simply can't count on it to work and contacting the company is just about impossible."}, {"title": "Garmin 2610...Excellent but Complex", "review_text": "In my opinion Garmin is the leader in the GPS navigation field.  Their products are the best, plus their customer support is great.  I have had the Garmin 2610 for more than 2 years.  I am always amazed how it \"Finds those birds in the sky\" and gets me to where I want to go without having to follow maps or printed directions.  When I bought the 2610, it was the smallest and best.  Over 2 years later it is still a great unit, but for many people it will prove to be more than they need.  In the past year, Garmin has been on a tear introducing new products.   As with most technology,  as a product becomes mainstreamed, the size gets smaller, more features become standard, and the price comes down.  The GPS automobile units have followed this scenario.For the discriminating tech person, this is the unit for you.  You can save up to 500 waypoints, see a diagram of the satellites it receives, and even know  sunrise and sunset times. This unit is loaded.  Does one really need all this?  I don't, but that was what was available when I bought it.  Truthfully, all I want it to do is safely direct me to where I want to go.  It should do so invisibly.  Isn't that the mark of really good technology?  We shouldn't have to push this and that button to figure it out.  It should be as simple as possible.  Once you set it, it does just that.  It just has more bells and whistles than most GPS units today.  Most people will never use those features.The 2610 does not have an internal battery.  You either plug it in at home to set it up, or you plug it into the power socket of your vehicle.  It comes with both cords.  Before I leave on a trip, I usually input what I need from my home/hotel, or wherever.  The unit remembers what you just found, so when you get it into the car, you just find the location from your recent finds, push \"Go To\", and in a few seconds it calculates your route and you are on your way.  Like most auto GPS units, the maps have points of interest you can access, such as food, fuel, hotels, shopping, etc.  Wherever you are, it will direct you to something close by, or far away if you desire.The unit comes with a \"Sandbag\" dash mount, which actually works quite well.  You place the sandbag mount on the dash, then clip the 2610 unit to it.  It is fine for moving the unit from car to car.  For a more secure mount, the unit comes with a mounting disk which is adhered permanently to the dash.  The unit just slides in and out of it.  A windshield suction mount is not available.  The unit is just too heavy for this type of mount. There is no way to just lay the unit on the dash, or anywhere else.  It must be mounted to something.  Remember, the unit needs to have an unobstructed view of the sky to \"See\" the satellites.  Some folks put it in a dash cubbyhole, or a cup holder.  If you do that,  you will need to purchase a separate antenna that sits on the dash.  (Very small size, around $20).While your vehicle is moving, you should never use the touch screen...or any of the buttons for that matter .  You are asking for trouble.  Input all your addresses you are looking for before you start your trip, or have a passenger do it for you when driving.  If a police officer sees you fiddling with the unit while you are moving, you can be cited for distracted driving.  Besides the ticket, it is very unsafe to even try it.  It is not like a radio.  Inputting info demands your attention.Let me list some pros (in no particular order):Push find 2 times and it will direct you home from wherever you are (of course you initially must set your home address).  That is a great feature.  The voice prompts are clear and early enough before a turn that I don't get in trouble by having to get over to this or that lane at the last minute.  The voice prompts do not announce the names of the streets or highway, but it announces things such as \"in .2 miles turn right, or keep right, or exit left in 500 ft.\" Prior to the turn, the screen will count down the distance precisely.  It is so precise, it counts down to 0 feet.  At times there is a street that I think I should turn onto listening to the voice prompts, but the screen shows me I have to go another few feet.  It is always right.  The voice works in conjunction with the screen prompts.  When you need to perform an action, the screen automatically zooms to a more detailed map, and a direction arrow (with the name of the street...etc) shown to you.  A quick glance at the screen is all you need to put you in the right direction.  However, it is the voice that does most of the guidance.  The screen is only to make sure of the name of the street, highway, etc.  Ever try to find an address at night...on an unlit road?  This unit will lead you right to the person's driveway.When the unit is not navigating, the screen moves along... a live shot of where you are, along with whatever you want the screen to display, such as cross streets coming up, addresses, driving direction, speed, etc.Negative things about the 2610:- It is heavy...and much bulkier than most units on the market today.  You do not have the ability to get a 3D view, only a 2D view (however, the 2D view works fine for me).- No internal battery.  You need to plug it into something.- The power plug has the speaker incorporated into it, and it is near where it plugs into the car power receptacle.  In some cars this can get in the way.  In addition, the length of the power cord is too short for some cars.- The unit comes with a 128MB CompactFlash card.  You will need to spend a few dollars more and get a 1GB or 2 GB card to load more maps.  Not a concern if you only want to load a few states.- Acquisition of satellites can take up to several minutes when first starting out from \"Cold\".  Do you drive during this time...hoping you are going in the right direction, or do you sit in one place with your motor running waiting for the birds to be found?- Like all mapping programs, even the current versions are out of date, especially concerning points of interest.- You must have a DVD drive on your computer, since Garmin now puts their maps on a DVD.  Many computers only have a CD drive.  I wanted to buy the updated map software but couldn't, since my computer does not have a DVD drive.In conclusion, the 2610 is a wonderful piece of technology, but it is one of the older models from Garmin. I would say that the best market for this unit is for those who are somewhat technologically inclined and demand higher end features in a GPS unit.  It is not for those who want the unit to just get them from point A to point B.  Garmin currently makes GPS units with less features, yet much easier to use and significantly less costly than the 2610.  It all depends what you want."}, {"title": "Unit works great, but customer service has no clue.", "review_text": "I have Sp2610 for a while, it wroks great for what I want. It even gives more information than my wife's Lexus factory GPS system. But one thing bad about is their customer service, I have their mapping software City Navigator North America Version 6.0 and update version 7.0. Although V 7.0 is a upgrade from 6.0 and give more POI from 5 Million to 6 Million they claimed. But when you actual do a POI search, V 6.0 will give you more locations. For instance I search Verizon Wireless, Chart House in So Cal, V 6.0 even has older information but it showed you more locations. Locations still in business doesn't show up on V 7.0. I checked on both my SP 2610 unit and Map Source software they provided to run on PC, same thing. Anyway to make a long story short, I emailed Garmin to see if I did somthing wrong when I upgrade from V 6.0 to V 7.0. I got a few emails from their technical people and claimed they purchased their Mapping software from outside vendor, they didn't know why V 7.0 showed less POI and Garmin can't change it. Sounds like pointing finger to their mapping supplier, instead of trying to find out why new mapping software issue. They are even selling $75 for mapping software upgrade.I don't recommend to buying any software upgrade from Garmin.

Because of the two handed design, you won't get the form-fitting design that you would get with other mice, but it is a compromise.The magnifier button is a great feature for people who are vision impared like me. You click the button, and you can get to access a magnifing function that creates an enlarged space on the screen where the mouse pointer is.

On the minus side, the carrying case would make a good substitute for a Rubik's Cube. (Instructions for using it are below.) Another caveat: The PX 100 doesn't seem as though it would stand up to hard use. The ear pads are foam rubber, and other than the metal head band, the rest is plastic.

But before doing this, notice these features on the headphones:The left end of the headband is labeled \"1\"--the right end of the headband is labeled \"2.\"Each headband end has a notch.At the point where the headphone wire splits into two wires, there's a little grey sliding tab.Okay, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you're an intelligent and accomplished adult who's mastered other difficult skills. You can do this. So let's get started:1. Hold the headphones so that the \"1\" and \"2\" on the ends of the headphone band are facing you.2. Fully retract the metal band on both sides.3. Gently turn the earpads so they click into place with the foam side facing away from you.4. Gently fold the headband end labeled \"1\" so that the earpad is almost touching the padded section of the headband.5. Gently fold the headband end labeled \"2\" and line its notch up with the notch on headband end 1.6. Gently push the notches together. You may have to hold the headband ends together with thumb and finger.7. Now slide the little grey tab on the headphone wires until it's snug against the earpads.8. With the folded headphones in one hand, pick up the carrying case with the other hand. The clear plastic side should be facing you.9. With the numbered ends of the headband facing you, slide the headphones (band side first) into the carrying case. Gently push it into place so that the headband is snug against the inside of the clear plastic housing.10. Wrap the cord around the grooved part of the carrying case. (Be sure you don't wind the cord outside the protruding tab.) When you reach the end of the wire, loop it around itself a few times and push the pin end inside next to the earpads.11. Snap the carrying case shut.12. Stand back and admire your work. If others are present, encourage them to applaud"}, {"title": "Good for the money!", "review_text": "When I went to buy the headphones from Amazon, the price increased from $38.99 to $55 overnight! Too much for me. I went through new egg and the shipped price was $45.

Don't hesitate to buy these but don't get your hopes too high. There are a lot of 5 star reviews on these headphones which I think are too high. 5 stars should mean the Ritz-Carlton of Headphones and these are not they.

I was impressed with the sound of the Sennheiser PX 200s until I tried the 100s and discovered the bass that was missing from the musical balance.  I can't explain the physics of why an open design like the 100s produces more bass than the sealed 200s, but it's a fact.  And placement on the ears is less crucial.  I've found the 200s comfortable to wear most of the day on a large head, so I expect the 100s to be the same.  I'm not sure when I'll get back to the Etymotic at twice the price.

Be aware that if you out walking around, you won't get the audio instructions because you have to plug the Quest into the car mount cradle which in turn is hardwired to the speaker built into the cigarette power adapter.When you are routing to a location, you may find that the unit takes a little longer to calculate the correct series of turns if you miss a turn. For example, I was riding my Harley Fatboy in downtown Wilkes-Barre, and missed a turn. By the time the unit recalculated the route, I has already passed the next turn that it had determined I needed to take to get back on track. If you miss a turn, slow down or pull over and give it the 20 seconds or so it needs to figure out how to get you back on track.Power consumption seems fine, no issues there at all.

Between the audio alerts and the letter and bar display, I've got a good idea what I'm receiving, and, from where.  Without an arrow.Generally, heat is the worst thing for ALL radar detectors.  That means not leaving the any unit out in the sun when parked.  It is also a good idea to avoid spikes of electricity by not having it plugged in when starting the motor, and using the power/volume wheel to turn it on and off.  Remember, excessive heat is BAD for your radar detector"}, {"title": "Works.  Looks cool.  Prevents tickets.  What else do you need to know?", "review_text": "I was going 75 in a 40, up a hilly highway last night, to get by a logging truck before a long stretch with no passing zones.  There was some downhill traffic, but no cop-like vehicles I could see.  But Mr. Escort blinked his lights (the one on the power supply as well as the blue LEDs) and sounded his chirp (which is loud enough for me!) and I buried the brake pedal to get my bimmer down to the legal speed.  Then the signal went dead.  None of the downhill vehicles was the fuzz, so my first thought was \"dangit, that false alarm is going to get me stuck behind this truck for five miles!\" but then I saw Mr. Smokey in the trees just off the road, using pop-radar in his unmarked car.  He had just clocked the downhill cars, that's where I got my signal.\"BUzzzzzz!\" Mr Escort said again when the copper clocked me, and I'll bet HE thought \"a BMW going 40? He knew I was here.\"  But once the cop was out of view,I zoomed by the truck , and thanked the Escort Co. for the 50th time this year.  I have not gotten a SINGLE ticket since I installed mine, and many, if not most, would have been unavoidable without it.If you drive a lot, and you don't like being passed by grandmas, BUY THIS DETECTOR.

Currently an excellent $/GB value.2.) Build quality is great (solid metal backplane). Screen will scratch, but one of the many available screen protectors will address this problem.3.) User interface is well-deigned. I'm a fairly big guy (6'1\") with large hands, but I have no problems operating the 4 buttons arranged around the scroll wheel. I was apprehensive about the scroll wheel, but it works great for me. The fact that it - unlike the iPod wheel - is raised a bit (i.e., has a positive profile) makes it easy to locate with your thumb when the player is out of view.4.) Battery life is excellent; I've never run the unit to full discharge, but with heavy use on trans-pacific flights I've never gotten close to battery-empty status, so the stated 20 hrs. seems very realistic.(Remember that turning the brightness down will do wonders for battery life...)5.) My player is loaded to capacity, and it takes apx. 10-15 sec. for booting, no more.6.)

I downloaded drivers for my PC, I downloaded drivers for the  e280 MP3.  I was on the phone with Sandisk for an hour (and they were OK).

I called Sony just to make sure I did have the 2.0 usb ports.  They walked me through hell and high water.  The only thing left for us to do was to wipe out my computer and reformat it just to see if the MP3 player would be recognized.  I wasn't willing to do all of this because I would have to back up all of my data on my entire computer and then reformat it.  Another few hours of work after I already spent 5 hours speaking with both Sony and Sandisk.  The mp3 player is just not worth it to me.  Good price, but never was recognized by my computer.  It did charge up however, and the menu was working.  But, I never downloaded any music to it because I couldn't get connected.  Now I know why it was such a good price.

I guess I have to go with another player.  boo ho"}, {"title": "Sansa E280", "review_text": "When my Zen Micro blew up on me a few weeks ago, I decided it was time to purchase a new MP3 player. I had long tried to avoid the iPod but after playing with a friend of mines new 8GB iPod Nano I decided I would get one. Fortunetly, I stumbled across the Sansa E280 by chance while looking for a good deal on the Nano. I decided to take a chance on this relatively unknown device and am now thrilled that I did!While it is basically the same width and height as the Nano, it is slightly thicker which might bother some people but I still don't even know it's there while in my pocket. The Nano has a color screen which can be used to view photos and 8GB. It's actually a nice little player but compared to the Sansa E280 it falls easily to a comendable second place. the E280 has an internal 8GB but there is a slot for a 2GB expandable memory disk! It is very easy to connect to the pc as well. I am by no means a computer expert and I use Windows Media Player to store my music. When I first connected the E280 to the pc, it asked me did I want to sync the two, which I said yes to. Ten minutes later the Sansa was loaded with all my music, no problems what-so-ever.In addition to displaying photos as the Nano does, it also plays videos. When reading reviews I thought this was a clever gimic but nothing worth using on such a small screen (it is only slightly larger than the nano's). I put an episode of South Park onto it when I first got the E280 and was suprised by the quality. I still wouldn't recommend replacing your tv with one of these but it is actually far better than I thought it could be. The packaged video coverter works well. I literally dragged and dropped the episode into it and the it was converted and transferred to the E280 before my eyes. The fm radio is also brilliant. My Zen Micro had an fm radio that never really worked. I didn't expect much better from my new MP3 player but once again I was suprised. No problems picking up the local stations at all.The player itself fits comfortably in my hand. The only complaint I have about the physical player is the rotating wheel. At first I was disappointed with it as it felt very cheap, particularly when compared with the rest of the player. I got used to this very quickly and don't have a problem with it anymore but I think it is worth noting all the same. The other complaint I would have about the player is that songs cannot be deleted from the player itself, you must hook it up to the computer and manually remove them.All in all, I would highly recommend the Sansa E280. Of the many MP3 players I tried out, this one really came out of top. It is beaten on size by the iPod, although the difference is near negligible. If your looking for a great little player packed with more features than you'd know what to do with, pick a Sansa E280 up"}, {"title": "Great player for the money, but room for improvement", "review_text": "I have a subscription service (Ruckus) so I didn't want to deal with iPod. I did a lot of research on non-iPod players before buying the sansa. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.Design is very sleek and the size is just right. The color screen has good resolution and pictures/videos are clear. Controls are very intuitive. The side buttons are a little hard to press, but if you buy a silicone case the buttons become raised making life a lot easier. The scroll button is kind of clunky as well, but I feel the sansa's other features compensate for it. Plus it's pretty neon blue... :)After reading poor reviews about the FM radio, I have to say it works great for me. I live in a pretty rural area where stations are always a little fuzzy and the sansa comes in just as well as anything else. The antenna wires are in the headphones (standard cheap-ish round earbuds which I find very uncomfortable). I'm planning on getting new headphones, so hopefully the radio still works ok. Otherwise, volume is good, almost too loud.I wish the package included an AC charger, but now that Sansa has been out for awhile, there are plenty of after-market accessories available. Sansa's website links to licensed products. There is also a memory expansion slot, which is a big plus over competitors. However, the battery life is longer than most players and it charges pretty quickly through USB. The downside here is that you can't use the player whenever it's plugged in. This makes for one of my bigger beefs: file management. It's a bit annoying if you just want to delete a song because it has to be plugged in. If you can't remember if you want to delete a song or not and would like to listen to it to check, heaven help you... You can't play anything (either through the sansa or the synced list on your computer) so this requires unplugging the player, listening, plugging back in, then deleting. I suppose this type of occurrence is rare, so I can deal.Initial ease of transferring files wasn't great either. After a day though, I'm a pro. Yes, you may have to read the manual, but it'll save a lot of grief down the road. Although it's easier to use off the bat than other players I've tried, it could be improved. The sansa allows you to drag and drop files on MSC mode and sync through Windows Media Player in MTP mode (my preferred method). It took me a few tries to import playlists \"as is\", but contrary to some reviews here it CAN be done. Make sure you're using the AutoSync feature instead of Manual sync in Windows Media. (easy enough to do once I read the directions!) If you do it right, you'll still have a library full of all songs and playlists that will only play certain songs. The Sansa also has a \"GoList\" feature, but I've found it to be worthless. In order to add a song, you have to be listening to it. You can't queue up a playlist like in any PC jukebox program. May as well just make playlists in advance then import them.While some things could be improved, I think the Sansa e280 is a very solid player and I'm glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to the ipod nano, based on both on price and function."}, {"title": "Very poor software", "review_text": "This product works only with Microsoft Media Player which is a very poor software, nothing for the real music fan.I have tested the sansa e280 in my office when it came and it worked despite all the problems with windows media player.

The \"buttkicking\" effect is awesome and syncs perfectly with sub (the bass signal is simply split between the sub and buttkicker amp).You'll be amazed at how much more in tune you'll be with a movie's bass signal.  Occasionally, you'll feel some bass that doesn't quite feel right because you don't hear it in the movie, but it is there.  You'll quickly become addicted to the buttkicker.  I have two rows of seating in my theater set up and only the second row has the buttkicker installed.  We never sit in the 1st row any more!If you really want to give the buttkicker a test run, I highly recommend any of the Matrix movies- insane amounts of bass!My only complaint is with the wireless unit.  Be forewarned if you go that route that the wireless RF unit can pick up noise fairly easily. The end result is that the buttkicker will jump and jerk when it isn't supposed to.  It took me some time to tweak the wireless unit to work properly.  It's nice not to have to run a wire the whole way back to your seating, but you may find more frustration in trying to use the wireless connection.In conclusion, this is a great product and a must buy to complete a home theater set up"}, {"title": "Buttkicker LFE Kit is awesome", "review_text": "I purchase the Buttkicker LFE Kit along with the wireless transmitter.

It's just one of four players in that niche; the others are Clark Synthesis, Aura Bass Shaker and Crowson.

It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer. And I love it. But there are some things you should know.It needs a LOT of power, so this LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver.Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two. Possibly more, but probably two. Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.  (You can drive up to four Buttkickers with a single Buttkicker Amp.)Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster. You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic. It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.All that said, it's a great addition.

Most of the time I have to play around with it for a few minutes before it decides to turn on.  Occasionally it will go hours or days before it decides to work.  The Itrip is extremely unreliable due to this problem.  Example:  My wife and I left for a 3 hour road trip.  We get in the car, back out of the driveway and the Itrip won't turn on.  My wife played around with it for about 30 minutes and gave up.  Finally, when we're about 10 minutes away from our destination, she decides to give it one last try (since I was ready to toss it out the window at 70 mph) and it turns on on the first try.

The product itself works; you just need to place it within a foot or two of the stereo.  My best suggestion for those who are considering not buying the iTrip because of the bad reviews is this: go do a search for radio stations in your city, and look to see if there are any big gaps between stations.  For example, in Houston there's a 92.1 and the next station is 92.9, which means that 92.5 would work pretty well since there's minimal interference.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it could have been a bit cheaper, but at least this one allows you to digitally choose and empty station, whereas the cheaper ones (like Belkin) only has four factory presets."}, {"title": "excellent condition", "review_text": "the calculator was brand spanking new and in perfect condition. amazon had the cheapest rate around for it. two thumbs up"}, {"title": "Very good financial calculator", "review_text": "I am taking a master's level into to finance course.

With Itunes you can change songs using a batch method, but with Creative's software, you have to go through EVERY mp3 one at a time!  That's a lot of songs on a 5GB player!  What takes seconds with Itunes, takes hours and hours and hours with Creative.The Micro would keep rebooting, and was very slow between songs.

Speakerphone function of the handset is excellent.  The voice quality is great.  This is one of the main reasons for buying this phone.2. It's a 5.8Ghz spectrum phone, which means it doesn't clash with my wireless network like 2.4Ghz does.3. It looks good.Bad:1. This is why it only gets four stars:  When it is docked in the charging cradle you can't use it.  This is extremely irritating especially if I use the handset heavily and deplete the battery.  I have to plan when to cradle the phone in order to make sure it keeps an adequate charge.  This might not be a problem if you keep the phone base nearby, but mine is in an attic office with my VOIP box and Internet connection.2. Doesn't work very well with a headset.  This seems to be a common problem with wireless phone handsets - when you plug a headset in people can barely hear you.  I had to purchase a Plantronics headset with an amplified microphone in order to get a working solution.Update:  I purchased an additional handset for the phone - model number TCX905.  My major niggle is now moot, as I can charge one handset while the other is in use.  An additional bonus is that the handset can also be registered with the other line in the house if I need to use it with that phone.

That turned out to be a bad decision.After charging and trying to watch my first movie I thought I had got a broken unit because the screen viewing angle is vertically maximum 20 degrees. Basically you have to tilt the creen forward and look on the screen slightly from above to even be able to see the picture. It is almost impossible to view the screen straight. Secondly the picture quality is really poor and the image becomes pixelated (you can actually see the individual pixels in the screen) due to the low resolution in the screen.The contrast is bad and all dark areas merge together in a movie. Initially I thought the DVD I was looking at was a poor copy because the image quality was so bad. I was so convinced that the unit was broken that I took it back and changed it for a new one. Then I relaized that the unit wasn't broken, it was the design that was broken. Since the replacement unit was equally bad.Then I happened to read the specs for the display used by Sony and it turns out that the vertical resolution is only 200 pixels on an 8\" screen. That clearly explains why I could see individual pixels in the screem while wathcing a movie.So, the bottom line is that this player has a very nice design, long battery life but completely and utterly useless with the built in very low-resolution LCD. So, the point of the whole device is lost.So now I have it in the Office purely as a DVD player and use it with a small Denver LCD TV which has a magnitude better screen.I can only speculate why Sony chose such a poor display but I suspect that it was very power efficient to allow them to have the exceptional battery life"}, {"title": "Great DVD player for the price.", "review_text": "I ordered this DVD player and when it came to recharging the battery it wouldn't recharge.

It's been about a week now and we haven't heard back on whether or not they are fixing that one or if they have any replacement units yet.  Don't recommend it.  It's also a little on the heavy side (maybe some people would like that).  Our last one was a panasonic 50 (old version I think) and it died after about 18 months - we thought that was unacceptable so we bought the Sony - but in retrospect I wish we had bought our old one again.  It lasted longer, was lighter weight and the screen tilt was more versatile."}, {"title": "DVDs to Go", "review_text": "I wanted a portable DVD player that I could prop up on the treadmill at the gym and watch movies while I burned away the calories. The Sony does the job admirably.I must admit, I didn't do a lot of research on this purchase. I started by buying a $79 special, which worked okay, but felt kind of flimsy. So I returned it and got the Sony.One thing that seemed surprisingly similar between the cheap unit and the Sony was picture quality. Resolution just doesn't seem to be great on these units. But since you're only looking at an 8\" screen, the picture does appear crisp, with decent contrast. The screen is glossy, and prone to glare, but it hasn't been a problem, even in the brightly lit gym.The screen will swivel and fold into a tablet, with all controls within easy reach. The player comes with a remote (a big one for such a small player), but I haven't even unwrapped mine. I suppose it might come in handy if you used the player's outputs to a large screen and home theater system.[UPDATE] I wanted to finish watching the disc in the player, and rather than taking it out and changing players, I just plugged it into the inputs on the front of my TV, found the remote, and I had a full functioning DVD player. It even picked up where I left off in the movie I was watching.Battery life is close to 5 hours, about twice that of most similar players. An AC adapter/charger, and auto adapter are included. Headphones are not, but ports are provided for two sets.I've heard that an extended warranty is recommended, but the player comes with a 12 months parts and labor (as opposed to the typical 12/3 terms). I figure if it breaks after a year, there'll be something slicker and nicer available to spend my toy budget on.So far I am quite happy with this player. It fits perfectly on the treadmill, and helped pass the hour long wait at the doctor's office. A nice diversion for automotive or motorcycle passengers, too.Great battery life, swiveling screen, and pleasing design make the Sony Portable DVD Player worth considering. Oddly enough, Sony released a 7\" Walkman DVD player about the same time. I can't figure why they would compete with themselves. I like the one I got because it seems more versatile, and the screen is better protected when closed. It sounds, from the description, that the `Walkman' might have better audio features."}, {"title": "Quite Pleased", "review_text": "Purchased it through Radio Shack due to a gift card I received.

Sony offered to exchange it also since it was only 6 weeks old but I would have had to pay shipping and Sony said I would get a refurbished unit and not a new one. Sony, That is very bad custome service!! The glare people talk about is not that big of a deal. Battery life is excellent. Picture quality is more than good enough for watching movies. Usually I don't waste money on extended warranties however considering the price and the fact that at least 4 other people I know of including one other Amazon reviewer have had the speakers die or the unit just stopped working I must say GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!! Unfortunatly the name SONY (think of all the lithium batteries they are recalling)is no longer a reason to assume quality. Too bad on that note"}, {"title": "I'd recomment it!", "review_text": "The main reasons why I bought this DVD player is because: 1) I loved the way it looked (very sleek and stylish), 2) it was in my price range, 3) it said it had a 6 hour battery life, and 4) it has two headphone jacks.Cons:--The glossy screen makes for a lot of glares.  to fix this problem, I hold up something dark in front of the screen!--If you like to watch old movies on DVDs in wide screen, you're out of luck.  It can only play those movies in full screen mode, which means you have a tiny screen (however, I don't know of any other DVD player that has fixed this problem)--I think the screen is pixely, in other words, the pixels are quite large.  It bothered me because it makes the picture less defined.  However, an advantage to this is that your kids won't be tempted to keep their faces inches away from the screen and ruin their eyes.  The farther away you hold the screen, the better the picture looks!--The twist screen only twists in one direction.  I sometimes forget which direction that is, and risk breaking the thing.--the sleek remote isn't very sleek; it's about 1/3 the size of the player itself, and maybe 1/2 as thick.  I found that quite amusing.PROS!--It's a beautifl design.  The speakers and buttons are all on the screen which makes the tablet design wonderful.--you really do get 6 hours of battery life.  Of course, this is on the dimmest screen setting; but I've been able to watch at least 2 movies in good lighting on one charge.--You don't need the remote to watch a movie.  there are some settings that you can only make with the remote, but i've actually never needed to change those settings.--the speakers are loud enough...for a quiet room.  If you decide to watch a movie in a loud restaurant or (as I did once) in a car while it's being hailed on, you won't hear much.  But overall, i'm happy with the noise they can put out.--the package comes with everything you'll need!  a battery, a remote, audio/video cables, a car charger and a regular charger.--it saves your movie for you.  if you turn it off in the middle of a movie, you can turn it on and resume it right where you left off!--it automatically selects the right screen mode for the screen size (wide screen or full screen)...unless of course it's an old movie.--there's an IR reciever on the screen as well as the front of the player.  So whether you have it in tablet setup or regular dvd player setup, you can use the remote.The dimesions for the player are:9 in x 6 in x 1.75 in (with the batery on)the remote is:5.5 in x 2.5 in x 0.75 in.Also good to know:--the \"open\" button on the front of the player is not to open the screen (the screen has no latches or buttons holding it closed), it's to open the place where you put the DVD in.--Charge the batter completely before you use it for the first time.  I charged mine for about 5 hours the first time; but i think it was done after 3.--I'm very picky about protecting this thing, so I chose the Targus hard-shell 10\" case (model #TDC004US) and the icon dvd player neoprene sleeve (total cost ~$60).  I put the player in the sleeve and then i put that inside the targus case, and pile all my cords and remote around it.

I've had mine for about three weeks.As much as I like this player, there are a few reasons I'm only giving it four stars. First and foremost, the player has no screen mode for accommodating older wide-screen DVD's. When you watch one, you'll get black bands on all four sides. If you switch the LCD mode to Full, it only stretches the picture horizontally. It does a great job, however, on more recent  \"enhanced for 16x9\" discs.I'm not sold on the idea that glossy screens are a good idea on laptops or DVD players. A glossy finish supposedly makes the colors more vibrant, but it also means that, unless you're in a very dark room, you're always going to get reflections, particularly in scenes that are darkly lit.The player is heavier than I expected. It is heavier without a battery than my older 7\" Toshiba player is with a battery attached. While this gives the impression of  a solid, well-made product, it also makes me worry about how severely it could be damaged if dropped on a hard surface.On the plus side, the twist and flip tablet mode is well thought out with all of the controls running along the bottom of the screen. This could be improved by having a way to differentiate the buttons by touch. The picture quality is as good as you're going to find in an under-$200 player. The battery life is impressively long; I'm getting 5-6 hours per charge.  Both AC and car adapters are included.  Unlike my older player, when you turn the DVPFX810 off, it remembers where you stopped watching and resumes play at the same point. For me, this player is well worth what I paid for it"}, {"title": "Not too shabby!", "review_text": "Review for the Sony DVP-FX810. Primary use: Aboard our boat and usedwith second 13\" flat screen.Well, like most people we've all been looking at these portable DVDplayers for years. Remember when they were 400-500 dollars or more? Nowwe have a large selection available for far less. The Sony weighs in ata bit under 200 dollars. If you read the reviews on these players,you'll generally see some happy users and an almost universal amount offolks whose units went belly up fairly soon.Here's the bottom line. Just about ALL of these players are builtcheaply. Speaking to a friend and a large retailer, I learned thatalmost all see a fair amount of returns, including the pricier units.No matter which unit you buy BE SURE to buy an extended warranty so youcan get a replacement if it dies.Now....on to the Sony. This unit appears to be better built than mostof the others. It has a solid feel and the screen hinge is more robustthan others. The unit is slim, black and looks more like a 400 dollarunit when sitting next to entries from Toshiba or Magnavox. The screenrotates 180 degrees in one direction and will fold back flat againstthe unit creating a tablet type player/viewer. This is perfect forheadrest or wall hanging, but Sony has made no provision for this soyou'll need to improvise.Screen quality: Well....here's the meat and potatoes. Based on my manyyears of audio and video usage on the higher end of the market, I'd saythe FX810 has average video quality, which is to say less thanstunning. Viewing the screen dead on makes for poor viewing. Tilt thescreen a bit and you get a more contrasty effect. Resolution ispassable, but nothing to write home about. Frankly, none of the smallscreens are very impressive and offer less detail than a good notebookcomputer. Still, the image is \"just fine\" for it's intended purpose andwatching a movie is no problem. Color and hue have that less thanaccurate LCD look, but again, quite passable as entertainment.Sound quality: Pretty weak, as on every one of these units withoutexception. A pair of headphones or even cheap external powered speakerswill help a lot. This is not a flaw, but a limitation due to the sizeof the player. Sony did what they could with some very tiny speakers.Battery life: WOW! Sony's battery is a killer and ran my unit for twowhole movies, well beyond 4 hours and had power to spare. This may bethe best on the market in this regard. Charge times are somewhat long,taking nearly five hours. The unit will charge while playing as welland will work off the included AC adapter or 12 volt cigarette lighterplug.Feature set: This is a pretty basic unit. It won't play DTS tracks andit has only composite out. I feel that without S-Video and progressivescan, Sony has focused on making this a more solid unit in other areas,such as overall build quality. The FX810 ships with a remote that isfull size. It's a bit odd to have such a clunky remote for a portableDVD player, but it's easier to use and won't have you hunting forlittle odd batteries used by the credit card remotes. Video in/outplugs are included with RCA's to connect to a TV. You can also send ina video game or video camera signal in. A single switch toggles betweenAV in/out.Another Bottom Line: Do YOU really need one of these? I have a DVDplayer with 7.1 dolby in my van, but I wanted a small player for my 35foot sailboat that could also feed a larger 13\" screen. This fits thebill. Features like progressive scan would be a waste on something likethis. The long battery life is nice and folks who fly a lot willcertainly appreciate that. If Sony makes a version with a 10\" screen,higher resolution and keeps the battery life they'll see quite a fewsales. In the end I still feel this is one of the better units, if notthe biggest, around. For under 200.00 it's fun and cheap, but lookspricey. Just spend a few dollars more on the warranty and you'll begood to go!Capt RB35s5NY"}, {"title": "Clearance Bargain - and has some oomph!", "review_text": "These were on sale for $109 at our local area all-in-one shopping center... Bought one of these, and also found a JBL On Stage II for a substantial discount.  The JBL looks like a much higher end item, the iRhythm system looks very \"plastic\", but does match nicely with black ipods.The Sound: The iRhythms system has a LOT more low end (you can actually FEEL the bass), but is lacking on the top end.  You can change your EQ on the ipod to boost the treble, or use an acoustic setting and get a pretty good sound.Whereas the JBL sounds very clear and crisp, but no matter what settings you use on your ipod, you will never get bass like the iRhythm system.Music Style:  It all depends on the type of music you are wanting to listen to.  But if you can find one of these for less than $120 and you like to listen to pop, rock, or things where you want to actually feel the bass thump, you can hardly beat this for a smaller system.

But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts.

I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me.I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins!

The earphones are really nice, not like the crapy ones all my friends have on their video and first generation nanos. The outside non-scratch is awesome. I got my iPod on Sept. 29 of 2006, (a friday) and left to go camping less than 4 hours later. Ofcourse I took my iPod with. We camped on DNR land in the middle of no where in our trailor. So I ran around, rode my dirtbike, climbed trees, and a whole lotta other stuff while carrying it in my pocket. I dropped it a few times, and it doesn't have a scratch!!!! The only bad thing is it's so small, and easy to loose. I recomend getting a screen cover though. But you really don't need a case to keep it safe, cuz that would just hide the color of your iPod. It has 4 great games on it, and stores a ton of photos. It loads super fast, and is easy to update. The color screen rocks to the fullest. It's definatly worth the money.

I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them.I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected!I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection.I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs.People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso.

Both excellent earbuds although the bose excel somewhat in overall sound quality. At first I found that a \"perfect fit\" did not equate with perfect sound. I got good isolation with the rubber tip but couldn't help but feel that the bass was lacking. I then tried out the foam tips, and voila the bass was there. The foams aid in creating the isolation seal by expanding once they are placed in the ear canal - the rubbers and PVC do not. For this reason the foams are probably easier to fit than the other 2 since you can compress them and get them in snug no matter what your ear size.As with the bose, I had to adjust the equalizer on my ipod a bit until I got the buds to sound the way I liked (Piano setting).The E2c definitely provide clear highs and lows - I was actually able to hear brass players in a classical piece breathe. I've used shure products as a musician and am happy to say that they have yet to dissapoint.Oh and WOW - these things are really good at blocking out sound. No more going deaf from blasting non-isolating headphones on the subway while listening to kids screaming. Ipod volume setting hardly reaches 50% and that's with \"sound-check\" on"}, {"title": "Do not doubt the Noise Canceling capability", "review_text": "Ok. So when I bought the Shure E2c my intentions where to just test them out and see if they were really noise cancelling then return them if they didnt work as advertised. $90.00 Dollars for a set of ear buds is a lot more than I was going to pay for them but after using them and putting them to the test I will keep them.I first tested them against a crowd of people. No kidding once I put the ear buds in my ear and played music to the lowest level. I couldnt hear anything but the music. People tried talking to me but I couldnt hear them. Even after pausing the music I still had to take the ear buds out of my ear to be able to hear them clearly.Second test was in a plane... again same result. I heard only music not the guy next to me snoring, not the plane engines.. shut I missed the meal being served bc I didnt hear the stuartess asking for what I wanted to drink and eat.Third and fourth tests are the reason why I'm keeping this ear buds. First, I used a ramdom set of ear buds next to a running UH-60 Blackhawk (an Army helicopter) and I could hardly hear the music at the highest volume. Then I used the Shure E2c and I honestly couldn't not hear the helicopter running. I could feel the wind from the main rotor system but I did not hear noise. My volume level was surprisingly low and the music sounded great. I moved closer and closer and I even sat inside the running blackhawk and I was left speechless.  These ear buds will leave you completely satisfied.Make sure, however, that they fit you properly otherwise they will not work well. They should not hurt when you place them in your ears. If they do pick a smaller size ear fitting (they come with like 10 different sizes and types). If they are too loose go one size bigger. It takes a good 30 minutes to figure out which size works well but once you get them right you are done.Overall, great product. 5 stars no doubt."}, {"title": "High performance but pricey...", "review_text": "High performance in a lightweight package, but a bit on the pricey side. The   intonation and definition are very good, but again that's what you're paying for.

The package includes a nice assortment of soft rubber ear adaptors so nearly everyone should be able to find a good fit. They begin to hurt my ears slightly after about an hour of use but a short break does wonders. The storage case is well made but a bit of a pain to use and a little bulky to store.

The Sony's are great, but take up a lot of space.  After all reading all the reviews it was a toss up between these and the E3C-Ns.  I bought these (first).They take a little work to get a good fit.  I already knew off hand that I wanted to use the foam ear pieces from all the reviews.First off, these are larger than you think (not heavy, just large).  You can definately feel them on and in your ears.I have a \"reference bass song\" that I use to test the bass on new headphones (\"Crystal\" off New Order's \"Get Ready\" CD) and they immediately failed the test.  Again, from the reviews, I knew that I needed to check the fit.  After a few more adjustments, I got the bass back (but it wasn't quite right).  After using them for about 4 hours or so, they did seem to \"break in\" and I was able to get the bass where I wanted it.I used these at night for sleeping and heard things in the music that I hadn't heard before.  As a test, I played a Def Leppard song off their Pyromania, an album I have listened to since it was released.  I couldn't believe the detail, at one point I think I even heard someone talking (or some form of unexpected vocals)...I was hooked.  After viewing the Shure website, I realized that I really should have gone with the E3C's due to their size (they actually state in their FAQ that the E3C's are better for those of us with smaller ear canals).

Television and FM/AM radio keeps you up up to date as well as the Weather Band channels.  There are 7 of them to choose from, and if you have NOAA broadcasts in your locality (which we do here, and it is Channel 7 on the FR300), you will receive 24-hour broadcasts from the NOAA and even emergency alerts, if the radio is set to receive them via the \"Alert\" knob.The other options of the radio are very useful, such as the bright 2-LED lamp built in.  They are VERY VERY useful for navigating the pitch black furniture-filled rooms of your house during a power outage.  LED's are very bright and use an extremely small amount of power.  Other features include a red strobe LED and a siren, for emergency use.The radio's most unique feature is a hand-crankable power generator.  The radio itself will run on three AA batteries, but it has a 3.6V rechargeable battery (such as those used in most cordless telephone handsets) which is charged when you crank the generator crank on the side of the radio.  Cranking it for a few minutes gives you a considerable amount of time to listen to the radio or use the flashlight feature.  This is VERY useful if you haven't planned ahead and stocked up on AA batteries, OR if you have been without power for weeks and can't GET batteries.  A true life-saver.On the back of the radio is a cellular phone charger connector, and the radio includes a cable and several adapters for the most common cellular phones out there.  I connected my Motorola phone to the radio, and when you crank the radios power generator crank, it charges your cellular phone.  You must continually crank the crank to charge your phone, but it's very handy when you have no other way to charge it.I can honestly say that after last year's hurricane season, this radio has been worth it's weight in gold.  It is very reasonably priced, includes a comprehensive manual and a carrying case to protect it.  If you live in a part of the country that is prone to power outages or natural disasters, for $50.00 you really cannot afford to be without one of these radios"}, {"title": "Save your money!", "review_text": "This is a cool idea, but the execution just isn't there for flight simulation.

Fedex delivered my lot in 4 days.  WHEW!Setup was easy.  Windows XP (Pro is what I run) has everything needed to make them work.  Plug and Play is all you have to do.  Of course calibration is a prerequisite for operation.The Fighterstick is modeled after a joystick found in a F16 Falcon.  Has a very nice feel.The toe brakes on the ch pro rudder pedals work perfectly.  A must for taxiing a radial to the runway.  The Pro Throttle glides real smooth.  They've made some improvements since the Gameport controllers.I've looked high and low for realistic flight controls and the only other that comes close is Thrustmaster.  I like Ch Products design the best.While the Pro Throttle isn't a true replica of an F16 throttle as modeled by Thrustmaster's HOTAS? Cougar, the ch pro throttle offers more versitility.  Don't get me wrong, Thrustmaster makes good stuff.  I want the versitility.  I fly a wide range of aircraft, including helicopters.Anyy way,... I won't say Ch is the best.... instead,...they are the best for me.

Instead, I'm sending these back.  Hopefully, they will learn (as many others in the industry have) that trying to lock customers in to buying only your products doesn't get you more customers in the long run. Most people will choose a non-proprietary solution when they can.CH tech support:\"You are correct it was a marketing and sales decision to have Control Manager only combine our controllers.

There are no future plans for allowing Control Manager to combine other brand controllers."}, {"title": "Must have for the serious flightsimmer", "review_text": "This review will talk about both the CH Rudder Pedals and the CH Flight Yoke USB.I finally got around to purchasing these rudder pedals from Amazon after accepting that I was NEVER going to find this item in stores. (...)Getting to the point...these pedals are a must have for serious flightsimmers...especially if you own Microsoft Flight Simulator and like to fly general aviation or the large commercial heavies. I also purchased the USB CH Flight Yoke for $99.74; the difference these 2 items make to the simming experience can't be stressed enough. If you ever got the guilty feeling after mastering the greased landing with the Boeing 747 or other heavy aircraft (the feeling that it's unrealistically easy), then this is the next level. It takes a lot more concentration and coordination to master flight using yoke and rudder as opposed to just a joystick or keyboard...just keep your hands off the yoke while going down the runway or taxiing, and you should be able to keep things in order! You may also consider purchasing the CH Throttle; that's going to be next on my list, because using the throttle controls as they are postitioned on the yoke are a little inconvenient for some aircraft that require constant changes in throttle position.Overall, I'm satisfied with the construction of the pedals; they weigh in at around 6 pounds and feel fairly solid and sturdy. The motion is fairly smooth with the application of both rudder and toe brakes. They work well. Not much more you can say about that. The same can be said about the construction of the yoke...fairly solid considering. I would like to have seen a little less tension on the yoke personally. Unless you are trimmed close to overtrimmed status, you have to give it a good pull to get airborne. I haven't studied it long enough to see how that REALLY compares between heavy versus light aircraft. But again, I think that only speaks to the construction of the unit and the strength of the clamp setup; pulling back on that unit with a fair amount of force and the unit doesn't budge from the desk. The yoke may take some getting used to based on where it will sit on your desk...in my case, there is about a half an inch beneath the fastened clamps to allow for my slide out keyboard tray, which was enough space in my case. I could see a potential problem in that area for others.I've read about complaints with the clamp system on the yoke, but I'd like to meet the guy that can think of a better solution to keep the unit stationary on your desktop...no problems with my particular desk and the clamps. What I've read is that people with lips or other unperfect edges may have problems since the surface area of the clamps is small. Again, not a problem with my particular desk. Another con that I read about and can somewhat concur with is the trim quality. I find myself having to adjust the elevator trim more frequently with changes in speed than with my joystick...on approach this can be viewed as a nuisance or part of the greater challenge. I'll have to give it some time to decide on that one. It may be that it's just easier overall with a joystick. I was looking for more realism and a greater challenge when I purchased the yoke and rudder.Installation was a breeze in Windows XP; just plug them in and they are ready to go. They come with a cd with any drivers that may not be installed already, and also games (so, I've heard...MSFS is my favorite past time, probably wouldn't fly anything else that I don't already own anyway). Another good thing about this unit and MSFS is that it is recognized as a separate controller. I have used the pedals in combination with the flight yoke as well as my Saitek X52 Flight Control system when I needed a joystick and not a yoke for flying fighters or even general aviation aircraft that have sticks and not yokes.Finally, both the yoke and rudder are a very good investment for the hobby. You'll find yourself enjoying the hobby more and actually steering clear of the autopilot controls. Hope this gives you some things to think about"}, {"title": "Great Linux-powered router with USB storage", "review_text": "As soon as I received my Linksys WRTSL54GS, I flashed it with the OpenWRT firmware... and my device works great.

I have wasted nearly 8 hours today trying to get this router to work with a Maxtor USB hard drive.  1st, this router will not allow you to use NTFS format so I had to reformat the hard drive to FAT32.  Next, when you go to set up the storage unit and give it a work group name it does not accept names that Windows XP does for example our workgroup is Horton house.  The Linksys unit will not accept the space between two words so I could not use the same workgroup name and either had to change every computer or let it be in a different workgroup.  Next I spent an hour on hold and then was transferred to four people before they finally could connect me with a tech support person who was trained on this new unit.   They confirmed my issues and said they will notify the group who will be putting out the next firmware update.  The big issue I tried to resolve was getting the unit to not require a user ID and password to access the drive everytime you boot up a computer on the network.  Unfortunately I learned that is the way the unit is designed so you can not map the location as a drive letter and have it always ready to use on a network computer.  The 1st time you try to use each you are prompted for a user ID and password.  This really finished it off since I could not understand the logic.  I can map other computer hard drives for automatic use but not this one hooked up to the router.  Then the final kicker I learned after my 2 hours on the phone with support.  Every file that gets written on the hard drive had a created date of Dec. 31, 1979 and last accessed date of the same.  I copied files to the drive and it would ignore their file creation and access dates and just write Dec. 31, 1979 for every file and folder copied on to the drive.   Clearly this router is worthless as a attached storage device at this time and I will pass it on to some one else on Ebay and go back to the old router.

As long as the antenna has a clear view of the sky you're fine.  It doesn't come with any extras (mine didn't even have an instruction manual!) but it's not hard to figure out.

Good cable, adequately strain-relieved where it feeds into the housing.  I always route the cable through the metal D-ring that attaches the battery housing on the back of the 60CS, better protecting the fragile MCX connector.  There are two magnets in the housing under a piece of tape.  These allow you to mount the antenna to a magnetic surface such as an automobile roof.

Buyer BEWARE!", "review_text": "Before you purchase this TV, be a smart consumer and read the reviews by typing in the product name in Google. I had the same problems that many of these people have stated. I bought the set in January 2005, and in March 2006, the picture and sound stopped working, and I was getting a flashing red light. After reading all of the comments on the net, I contacted Sony. I thought I'd share my story, so maybe some of you would be better informed about the set before buying it, or if you already have and it breaks, take heart and fight the way I did.First of all, Sony DID pay all of my repair costs, parts and labor. I had to stay on the phone for an hour and go through about 6 different levels of customer service. I told them that I was reading all of the complaints on the Internet about this particular model and that I knew they had made a defective TV with this brand, so I wasn't going to quit until they fixed it at their cost. They hemmed and hawed, saying it was out of warranty. Then they agreed to pay for parts. After listening to me tell them that a 1-year old set that I paid $600 for should not be broken, that Sony is a billion-dollar corporation, and that I was reading hundreds of examples from people who had experienced the exact same problems with this set, they finally agreed to fix the set at their cost, which they did.I took it to a service technician they suggested, who turned out to be a jerk, but I can live with that. I took a week to fix it, and I had to stay on Sony the entire time, especially when they tried to say they were only paying for parts, but they did eventually pay for the entire thing.Just so you know, the technician told me that this TV is defective. The boards are bad. It's the A and C boards. They go out after 6 months to a year. He said the best thing you can do is to turn off your TV after watching it (don't leave it on all day or night). And to expect the boards to go bad even after replacing them. He also said Sony is aware of the problem. Sony tried to tell me they would have put this info on their web site if that were the case, but, obviously, their own recommended service technician says differently.At any rate, you can and SHOULD stand up to Sony to get your TV fixed. If you want to use my name and experience, feel free. My name is Denise Culver. I bought my TV in January 2005, and it's a KV32FS120, and you're welcome to tell Sony that I appreciated their good customer service enough to share my experience with you in hopes that they would treat you with that same great customer service experience.Good luck"}, {"title": "AWSOME PICTURE AND SOUND", "review_text": "BOUGHT THIS ABOUT A YEAR AGO GOT IT ON SALE AT SEARS LOOKED GREAT ON DISPLAY IN THE STORE COMPARED TO ALL THE TV'S THEY HAD ON DISPLAY AND THEY HAD ALOT THE ONLY THING THAT CAME CLOSE WAS A TOSHIBABROUGHT IT HOME AND ALLMOST KILLED MYSELF GETTING IT IN THE HOUSE THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE HEAVIEST TV OF IT'S SIZE I'M NO WEAKLING THIS THING IS BIG AND HEAVYONCE INSTALLED AND TUNED IN ON DIGITAL SATTELITE IMAGE WAS VERY SHARP AND CRISP LESS DISTORTION THAN THE CURVED CRT TUBES  HAS SOME PRESET PICTURE MODES YOU CAN TOGGLE ON THE REMOTE THAT IS HANDY FOR DIFFERENT LIGHTING CONDITIONSONE OF THE THINGS THAT SUPRISED ME WAS THE SIMULATED SURROUND STEREO SOUNDS REALLY GOOD AND LOUD FOR A TABLETOP MODELTHE UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS ONE OF THE BETTER ONES I'VE SEEN EASY TO PROGRAM TO CONTROL OTHER DEVICES BUTTONS FEEL NICE AND GLOW IN THE DARK!

Also, I record FM radio at 3:00 AM when the commercials are not quite as prevalent (I have not actually run any experiments on this but it seems to be true).  I was afraid that all the menus would be too complicated and it would be difficult to figure out all the features, but I find that I use the thing enough to remember how to do the things I want to do.  Once you get into the routine of doing the timed recordings it is easy.  It is also not that difficult to figure out the menu path to take if you want to do things like recording with the microphone like an old cassette player/recorder.  I would recommend this if you are looking for an ipod that also lets you timeshift AM and FM."}, {"title": "Great radio!", "review_text": "I bought this for my son and he really loves it.

What few quibbles I have had have mostly been fixed with their software upgrades. It really is an amazing unit. Bang for the buck is huge and in its niche, it does what nothing else does, as well as I could hope for. Perfect? No. But I haven't played with a toy that is. The built-in mic for voice recording is O.K. but no auto gain control means the recordings get distorted when the volume gets louder. Or if you turn it down, the signal to noise ratio is bad.Buy one and enjoy recording your favorite shows when you can't or forget they are on. In fact, I am back today, over 1 year later, to buy another one for a gift for someone. I am that impressed with it. You can also use a 2 gig SD card if you format it as FAT32 while connected through USB to Windows and format it there. WooHoo! Now you are talking storage for audio"}, {"title": "Overall an excellent product!", "review_text": "I thought for quite awhile before making this purchase, and after reading the reviews I expected it to be somewhat problematic.  However, with reservations, I went ahead and made the purchase, thinking that I might have to send it back.  Fortunately, I am happy to say that I am pleasantly surprised with its performance and ease of use.  It is MUCH better than I expected.Most people seem to complain about the interface/manual.  I guess with so many products these days that are completely idiot proof, people come to expect things to be self explanatory, so complain when you actually have to read the manual to use it.  Yes, you will have to read the manual to use this, but you should expect that.  This isn't just an mp3 player, it performs many other functions as well.  You can record any AM/FM station.  You can set to record one time only, weekly, including presets for mon-fri, mon-sat, every day, etc.  Any combination is possible.  You can also record by line in (plug in any audio cable), and you can even record by microphone.  You can even set it to record by microphone at a scheduled time (spying device?).  You control the quality of the recordings as well, 32kbps, 64, etc.  You can set the unit to act as an alarm clock.  You can choose which programs are stored on internal memory vs a flash card.  This unit performs many different functions, and all with only like 8 buttons, as the unit to too small to have many more than that.  I received it and set it to charging while I read the manual.  An hour later, I was setting the record schedule without any difficulty at all, and I haven't had to use the manual since.  It is all very intuitive once you get the idea.  That being said, the manual could be written in a better, more user friendly manner, but it is certainly adequate as it is.The interface with windows couldn't be easier.  I plug it into USB, then use explorer to moves the files where I want them.  I can delete them, rename them, copy, move, etc, all through windows like you would any file.One reviewer complained that you couldn't record AM while it is plugged into an AC outlet.  This is partially true.  When I first set it up, I put it by my computer in the basement where the signal is quite weak, and the interference from the transformer made too much noise in the recording.  However, when I moved the radio upstairs to where the signal was stronger, this disappeared.  Even better, I set the unit up on a standard lamp timer so that the battery only charges in the middle of the night when I am not recording, so I don't have to worry about this at all.  This is only a minor annoyance, easily circumvented.My only other complaint is that it doesn't have enough built in memory (mine is the 128meg version).  Memory is so cheap these days, I would rather pay $20 more and have a gig or two so that I don't need to buy another flash card.  But it does have a slot for a 1gig flash card, so again, this complaint is only an annoyance, easily circumvented.One other issue people mentioned with the small USB port cover that wasn't attached to the unit.  I agree, it will get lost, but really, who cares?  My other mp3 player never did have a cover for this port.  It is also the port you use to charge the unit, so mine is either plugged into AC power or a computer at all times.  If the cover was attached, I would probably cut it off, because I just don't need it.It has performed flawlessly since I purchased it, and it seems to be very well constructed.  I have not had any problems with a \"popping\" noise that other reviewers mentioned.  I also get good AM and FM reception.  I hope to get many years of use out of it.  I am thrilled with it's performance, and don't regret my purchase in the slightest.  It's worth every penny"}, {"title": "Radio *My* Way", "review_text": "This is a talk radio listener's dream. I shopped around for an mp3 player/recorder, specifically to record satellite radio. I record almost daily. RadioYourWay is everything I want. A VCR for radio.The menu/display is quite intuitive. I read the directions for specifics anyway. The only time I was frustrated was when set up a timer schedule and later, couldn't figure out how to `delete' the schedule! Turns out, there are 20 slots for schedules and you can't delete them. Not technically - you `Disable' them. ANd the bookmark feature; haven't figured that out yet.Sound quality: Great for talk radio. (Join the Revolution!) Records to MP3. Pick your speed and equalizer mode. I can go as low as 32 kbps and sound quality is good. Record many hours and still have room for some music mp3s. My music sounds good too. Although, not excellent -- I'll repeat what other reviews state: This is NOT a player for solely listening to music mp3s. This is for recording radio programs.FF/RW/Speed/Repeat A-B/TIMER/Sleep: Excellent Features.Modes: There are 4 modes you listen by: AM, FM, Line/Mic, and Schedule. AM and FM - (Ten presets each.) Line/Mic: any Mp3 you've recorded. Schedule: Any timer recording. Once you start listing to a recorded MP3 (In either Line/Mic or Schedule mode) if you hit stop and turn the player off - it will hold your place. Unless you switch modes. Then you start over again. But there's something call Bookmarks - I haven't taken the time to figure those out yet. (!) Sounds like those will solve that issue and keep a `bookmark' in the file(s).Computer connection: Couldn't be easier. I have a Mac and RYW plugs just as any external hard drive does. No special software needed to install (on my Mac anyway, not sure about PC). Transferring files is easy - to AND from - as I please. It's not proprietary, ithank you very much. I don't believe I could transfer `a folder' at a time; it had to be a `file' at a time. Small glitch.Accessories: Pleased. Headphones are OK. The unit's cover for the USB port is tiny. TINY. When I opened the package I left it in there because I imagined that will get lost in no time. It would be nice to have the USB cover attached to the unit somehow, so you could just `flip' it open for a connection. I wish a case were included with the package. I might buy that later. Would like to see an FM transmitter function.AM/FM reception: I live outside the downtown area. Reception is generally great. However, in city, AM is not as good. A big consideration if you're in a big city. The antenna is just OK. I have to place it carefully at times to make sure I'm recording clearly.Battery Life: Good. I love not using batteries. Recharge every couple weeks. I have to record my 5 hour program with the power plugged in. Works out great.One last note, for comparisons sake: I bought an iRiver IFP-899 mp3 player/recorder. It's great. However, it lacks some of the functions and ease of the RadioYourWay. I love my iRiver, but not when I have 5 hour show to listen to. Reasons: 1. When I power off, I lose my place. 2. Takes forever to fast forward / rewind. (iRiver is for music. And/or 5-10 minute recordings.)Alrighty, then. Happy Recording"}, {"title": "A very useful little tool that needs better accessories", "review_text": "I have been using this Pogo for about 3 months and I have to say that this little guy still impresses me. The player itself does a marvelous job, but the accesories are almost laughable. It still deserves 5 stars hands down, just for its functionality and all the useful features that are packed into something the size of a deck of cards.I'll start off with a rundown of what I like. It does MP3's, FM and AM, you can record both radio stations and through the line input. I can also store PC files via the USB interface. Which BTW DOES give access to the internal memory card(bios updates are available online). There was no software to install, I just plugged it into my XP machine and wallah!!... two more drives popped up ready to use. One was the 128 megs internal memory and the other was the removeable 1 Gig SD card I bought seperate. Transfering music is a breeze, I simply drag and drop the mp3's or whatever other files I need to carry with me from my hard drive onto the player's drives and they are copied over. It really can't get any easier than that. No messing around with restrictive software.The interface is a little clunky to set up the first time, but I love the display information. It show's everything I would want to know about what I'm listening to in one glance, including battery life, song title, media type(AM,FM,MP3), there is a little equilizer bar pulsing, a gauge that show's how full the memory card is, and the sample rate. Something you'll almost never find on an mp3 player, it displays the TIME and DATE. Ya it's a small thing, but so often good players could be great if they just paid attention to the details. Oh ya, one more almost amazingly useful feature you'll never find on another mp3 player, it has built-in alarm clock functionality. Couple that with the builtin speakers and you can start to see how versatile this little guy is.A couple drawbacks, the buttons feel cheap when I press them, kinda like calculator buttons from the 80's. A rubberized attached cover for the usb port would have also been nice. It comes with a little plastic usb cover that was lost almost as soon as I took it off.The sound quality is more than acceptable and I found the battery life to be true to about 12-15 hours with standard behind the ear/neck rested earphones. I usually have the volume around 7 or 8 out of 30 and it very clear. I can't comment on the included earphones as I don't use earbuds because they are not comfortable to me. I plugged in some high quality studio headphones and it was able to power them no problem but I had to turn the volume up to around 18 for normal listening,and about 27 for the sound to be really loud, but not distorted. Which is really what I would expect for big power hungry headphones.I almost forgot about the builtin speaker.  It sounds just like an old transistor radio but the signal is crystal clear with no crackling. The sound cuts through nicely, especially for talk radio and audio books. A volume level of 15 is sufficient for a quiet room. I listened to the radio for 2 hours tonight at volume 15 and the battery meter still reads full. The AM antenna is built into the unit, but it uses the headphones as the FM antenna. If you want to listen to FM through the speakers, you have to unplug the headphones and plug in a special antenna that's included.  But who wants to drag around a spare antenna all the time. I just put the player on the table and insert the headphone plug into the jack far enough so that it makes contact and can act as an antenna, but not far enough to disengage the external speakers. That little trick works nicely.There are only two optional accessories available that I've seen, the charging cradle and the protective leather case. I'll comment on each.The optional cradle has little functionality. It charges/powers the player and allows it to stand upright. You can power the cradle via USB or the power adapter. The cradle provides no PC connectivity at all. It draws power from the USB cable and that's it.  So in order to hook up the player to the computer I have to take it out of the cradle and lay it down on my desk, then take the usb connector out of the cradle and plug it into the player. It doesn't seem right does it?? Obviously the cradle was an afterthought.The optional leather case is the other accessory.  From a functionality point of view, it's very accessible. I have no problems getting to any of the buttons or ports. It does a good job of protecting the player from nicks and scratches.  The clear plastic(on the leather case) covering the buttons and screen is starting to warp a bit, making it difficult to read the screen depending on glare. Why is it warping? I'll get to that later.  Aesthetically, the case is ugly and only comes in black. It really does nothing to compliment the player itself. It looks like an old style cell phone case that's been converted. A clear rubberized case would have been better for this player. There is also a metal belt clip attached to the back of the case that is clunky and gets in the way. I'm always getting the headphones tangled up in it. It would be nice if this was removeable so that people like me who carry it in my pocket don't have to feel it. It makes the device a little thicker and it doesn't lay flat. I took a pair of pliers, pulled out the rivot holding the clip to the case and managed to yank the belt clip out. It definitely wasn't meant to come off so if you like the belt clip, I can vouch for it's sturdiness. It's not flimsy.  With a little more effort the clip could have easily been made removeable.I'm not trying to rant, because I really like the player alot, and I rave about it to my friends.  I just find it funny that a device which seems to be designed so well, can have optional accessories that are so awful.  I'm only going to say one more thing about the accessories, and I hope someone from the company reads this, because if they ever fix this stuff, I'll be first in line to buy the new model.Earlier in the review, I said how the clear plastic on the leather case, covering the buttons has started to warp. That's because, when the player is inside the leather case, it's too thick to attach to the cradle. I have to take the player out of the case in order to use the cradle. Not to mention, there is no access to the charging holes through the leather case. I would cut holes in it if I could, but it wouldn't do any good anyway since it's too wide. So taking the player in and out of the case so much has caused the clear plastic, covering the buttons and screen, to start to warp. I would rather leave it in the leather case all the time. Consequently the only two accessories in the whole world for this player do not work together. Using one causes defects to crop up in the other. I really do find it hilarious and hopefully these problems can be addressed in the future.Keep in mind, the case and cradle are optional accessories, but the player is worth every penny!! You won't regret buying one."}, {"title": "nice device with some flaws", "review_text": "As stated by a number of previous reviewers, this device is great for recording broadcasts. The timer can be left activated for daily or weekly broadcasts on a repeat basis. A 512 MB card can hold around 4 hours of such broadcasts at a high 256 kps rate.I think the biggest flaw in this device is the horrible FM receiver, especially at the low end of the FM spectrum. This is where a lot of cheap radios have problems, and the PoGo is no exception. Splatter from other parts of the FM spectrum infects the band from 88 MHz to 92 MHz or so, where the most interesting stations (public radio and university free-form stations) are usually found. Simply moving the headphone cord/antenna a fraction of an inch can destroy reception on a lot of stations, too. So setting up to record a program can be an exercise in frustration, as you try to settle the cord into a position where it will pick up the station clearly.If the receiver was improved, I'd have few complaints about this cool device"}, {"title": "Great bang for the buck!", "review_text": "Love this phone.

The uniden however, on a Bluetooth call, allows me to go from my office, all the way to my mailbox.  Office is at the back of the house, so this is WAAAAAAY more than 10 meters.

The phone's caller ID system would not display the entries in my phone book but instead displayed the cryptic entries from the telephone company. Phone book entries were stored on each handset and there was no easy way to transfer entries between handsets so everytime I updated the phone book I had to do it on all three handsets I owned. (And I had to do it on my cell phone and my computer.) Most serious of all, the VTech system would get a lot of interference in my old home. So I bought a Siemens Gigaset SL-something to replace it.The Siemens system solved all my gripes about the VTech system. The caller ID showed the entries in my phone book, entries can be transferred between handsets wirelessly and there was no more interference. Still, I was not satisified. The handsets and the keys on the handsets were too small so they were hard to handle. I missed having a speakerphone on the main unit.

It works as advertised, and the implementation of the features is well done.The only criticism I have is that the documentation of how the Bluetooth headset will interact with the handset is very sparse. However, a little experimentation provided me with an understanding of its function.Basically, the Bluetooth headset main button (in my case I use a  Logitech Mobile Pro) gives the handset a \"press talk button and transfer call to headset\" command if the phone is on hook. If the handset is already off the hook, then pressing the headset button gives a \"transfer call to headset\" command.This means that you can pre-dial your number on the handset, then, instead of pressing the Talk button, you press the main headset button. The handset transfers the call to the headset and dials the number.You can also do other things with the Bluetooth functions, such as, using the handset to reveal a previously dialed number, then press the headset main button to redial the number.Lastly, an unexpectedly nice feature of this phone is that you can create alarms.

Here's some tips.", "review_text": "All the other reviews pretty much cover the details about this nice HDTV, so I'll just add a few tips I received so you won't be disappointed when you first hook it up. First thing when you hook it up, don't be disappointed with the picture quality of the non-HDTV channels. It's not your TV. It's the nature of the technology. For the most part, standard definition channels may not appear as clear on your HDTV as they do on your regular TV. Hopefully in the near future, almost all channels will be HD. Another important thing is how you set your settings. The default settings \"out of the box\" on the TV will not give you the best picture. First thing you should do is turn off \"DNIE\". It does much more harm than good. Set the picture to \"Warm 1 or 2\" depending on your taste. Turn down the contrast to around 40. Set the brightness to between 45-50. Turn the color down to about 45. Tint should be fine at about 50/50, and sharpness really doesn't make a difference with DNIE off, but most people set it at 0. Most people also turn \"DNR\" off, but I don't notice much difference.....Hope this helps"}, {"title": "WOOOOOW!", "review_text": "i just can't imagine anyone not being happy with this product. when you make any purchase, price has to equate with function to be seen as a \"good buy\". this samsung is right there! the picture is AWSOME! it's eye candy in a box. now as far as the price, approx $2400. delivered to my wall unit. it just doesn't get any better than that"}, {"title": "Awesome TV", "review_text": "We just purchased our Samsung 61' DLP and it's great.

Granted, this base is designed to sit there so it should not be an issue for most users. I did not have problems with the base's power cord staying in; mine was very snug.If you do not like exposed wires you should know that if you are using the WAN port, Audio jack, and/or the printer USB connection the wires will stick out a bit up and backward. This is especially true for the audio cable. If you're REALLY particular about how this looks, you might want to consider an audio cable with a small right angle plug and white cables all around to match the AirPort.My one suggestion is it would have been nice if they had designed a little notch to store the 2-prong plug that you have to remove from the AirPort to fit it in the base."}, {"title": "A must-have for AirPort Express owners", "review_text": "This product is phenomenal and is designed extremely well.

The styling of the AirBase is way cool, too. Very Apple like. And the weighted base ensures that it will STAY on your desktop or entertainment center. One note to the reviewer who complained that the cable was loose when she plugged it into her AirBase: If you're talking about the cable that supplies the power to the AirBase, just try pushing it in harder (you have to push it pretty hard). When I first hooked up my AirBase to my AirPort Express, I too was bummed because the power cord seemed loose and the power actually would cut in and out. I was almost to the point of wanting to return it, but thought I must be doing something wrong.

The Express plugs directly into a wall outlet (as you would a PowerBook's AC adaptor brick). You then connect your internet source via ethernet cable, and a printer and music speakers via USB and 3.5mm jacks respectively.  It has one multicolor status light showing the AirPort's readiness and network activity. The downside is that wall outlets are not always at the best height or orientation to facilitate optimal Wifi reception. Additionally, if the wall outlet is hidden behind furniture, the status light can be obscured.Like many Apple products, the Airport Express boasts artful, elegant industrial design. Griffin Technology's AirBase is the perfect compliment to the AirPort Express. It's design and craftsmanship rivals Apple's and it integrates seamlessly with the Express. To use: simply pull-off the Express's AC prong module, and slide the Express into the AirBase's socket. The express stands on the diagonal with the cables routing from the back, and the status light showing at front. The AirBase has a chromed metal lower half, reminiscent of the back of an iPod. The bottom sports an inset, non-slip rubber pad. In addition to looking nice, the metal base adds weight and prevents movement (say, from tugging cables). The back of the AirBase also has a matching chromed arch to pass the cables through. Making for elegant cable routing.As for the esthetic: The AirBase/AirPort Express combo is beautiful. This alone may not be enough to encourage you to buy. But before I used the AirBase, I was unable to receive a strong Wifi signal in the outer-most rooms in my house. The AirBase raised the Express to table height and allows for rotating the Express until the optimal reception is achieved. It raised my Powerbook's signal from one-or-two 'bars' before, to four-or-five bars with the AirBase. This boost is equivalent to what I experienced when I tried an amplified antenna with my Airport Extreme base station (I now have the Extreme on one floor and the Express on another in a WDS configuration). The only quality issue I had found was the AirBase's AC cord comes unplugged from the AirBase rather easily. I attribute this more to the quality of the cord's end than the base's power port. Also, more trivially, when the Express is attached to the AirBase, the Apple logo on the Express is upside down.

I consider myself moderately computer-savvy. The directions were clear, and I was able to install the software with no trouble. However, the print server did not work--- no test page would print. After much research on the Internet, using Google to find various forums, including a Netgear forum, I discovered that the Netgear USB Mini Print Server (PS121) is not compatible with all-in-one printers. A moderator on the Netgear forum stated that a person could use the Netgear USB Mini Print Server (PS121) with all-in-one printers by downloading printer-only drivers. It boiled down to (I guess) 1) choosing to use all three functions of my printer (printer, copier, scanner), but having to carry my laptop into the room with the printer, 2) only using the print function and being able to print from another room, or 3) buying a new printer that was compatible with the Netgear USB Mini Print Server (PS121). I chose to return the Netgear USB Mini Print Server (PS121). I rated this item only one star because I could not use it and because it was not obvious before purchase that many printers are not compatible (not merely the all-in-ones, as I found out through my research). I am very happy with my Netgear router, but not with the Netgear USB Mini Print Server (PS121). I highly recommend that a potential buyer visit the compatibility list on the Netgear website to make sure that their printer is compatible before purchase of the Netgear USB Mini Print Server (PS121)."}, {"title": "Excelent", "review_text": "Discs works quite well.

I first tried the Elecom Zeroshock case because of its superior protection (made from memory foam.) This case had two major problems: 1. It was way to stiff, so it did not have any \"give\" and 2. It was a bit too small.  When you combine these two problems (and pop an extended battery on your 700m) you get one EXTREMELY snug case, so snug that the black from the case was actually rubbing off onto the white trimming of the 700M (thanks Elecom.) So then I decided to try a neoprene case but before settling on the Vaio case above, I tried the Marware Sportfolio.  It fit wonderfully, unfortunately it fit wonderfully without the extended battery.  Also, the Sportfolio is more of an all-in-one carry-it-with-you-looks-like-a-briefcase type case.  But unlike a briefcase, this thing was small, didn't have space to put the charger, and was surprisingly impractical.  Plus, I wanted something that could fit inside my backpack and basically keep it  a little protected plus scratch-free.  So finally, I desperately came to amazon.com typed in \"neoprene case\" and found this gem (thanks to other reviewers who praised it's ability to fit their 700m.)Now, on to the case itself.  It offers 5 star scratch protection and I would say 3-4 star shock protection (its only neoprene so you wouldnt want to drop it.)  Overall I am extremely satisfied with the case because it fits perfectly with my 700m + extended battery and it even brings this mini neoprene case for the charger (which I suprisingly use alot!)  One thing thought since I mostly use it with my backpack, I tend to grab it just from the neoprene, so with all that weight its supporting some of the stiches have started to break, but this is easily fixed by me not being so lazy and taking it out of the backpack properly.  Oh, and it will also fit the Dell 710m since they are the same size.  5 Stars"}, {"title": "Good fit for the right price", "review_text": "I bought this for my Sony SZ110.

Yes I could make it louder, but then could not get the volume down! I had to stop using it because I had made the volume too loud. After a couple of weeks I went back to the Sharper Image store for an exchange. Only at the time the salesman confessed me it was not a great radio. I got an exchange, but found the same problem soon after I left the store.  I went back and finally got one without the problem.The story is not over yet. I knew that the set of battery was weak, so I changed a new set of battery with the new one I got.  After one month (right at this moment), the same problem appears again on the new one! This time I paid attention to the battery bar display (the radio has that), and the battery bar is flashing which indicates battery change. It seems that weak battery was the reason that the volume cannot be reduced. But I could not verify it 100% because I don't have six AAA batteries at hand. Yes, six AAA batteries.As an engineer myself, I would say the design of the radio has several simple and naive mistakes.  If it is true that the volume cannot be reduced when the battery is weak, there must be a simple design overlook.  (If not, that would be more serious and no one should buy it.)

The case is in two parts:  A silicon sleeve that covers everything except the screen and a hard clear plastic panel the covers the entire front with a nicely beveled hole for the spin-wheel.  There is a little hole+button where the hard plastic mates with the silicon sleeve.  The sleeve and plastic cover mate around the edge as well.There is a flap at the bottom to gain access to the dock port, a hole for the phone jack and contour for the control lock switch.The case is thick and you get an excellent, non-slip grip.  While you certainly would not throw your iPod around, you do get the feeling that when the inevitable occurs, (dropping, putting the unit in the same pocket as your car keys, etc.)  it stands a better chance of surviving.Accessing the spin-wheel, even in the blind, is better than a naked iPod.  The beveled edge guides you to it by feel and the slightly increased friction make fine volume control and menu travel much easier.I do have two minor criticisms.  The contour for the lock button does not work too well.  A flap, like the one for the dock port, may be better.Also, the case is fairly thick and the hole for the phone jack is too small to allow most jacks to be inserted all the way in.  While this has not been a problem, I think some lower quality jacks may not seat completely and may be prone to fall out.  I had no problems, however.  Again a plug/flap with a larger hole for the phone jack that will also seat into the jack when nothing is inserted may be an improvement.One other point to keep in mind; I am not able to fit this unit into any dock with the case on.

Assuming it lasts, it seems a very good unit for the money.  Here's why I bought mine, and some questions to ask yourself when you're choosing.  [Updated 8/28/2006]0. Do I want to make a fashion statement with my MP3 player?Some people will only buy a trendy iPod.  Buying a lesser-known unit like CZNP makes a different statement, and you can choose from 10 colors.  I prefer function over form, but CZNP offers some of each.  I bought an orange one because it is easy to find in my black bag.1. Do I want to play more than just sound?The CZNP is a basic MP3 player, FM Radio, and recorder.  It has a simple monochrome display and controls that make it a good choice for playing music, podcasts, and ebooks, and listening to local radio stations.  It can record from the built-in mike or radio, or from a line input, which may be handy for some.Some players can play videos, show pictures, etc, and cost a lot more because of the required color screen and larger memory.  I don't need these things and prefer not to spend the money needed to get them.Of course this player can STORE any kind of content, just like a thumb drive, but it only plays audio.2. Will I be listening to mostly music or mostly spoken content?When you switch off a unit while it is playing, or pause it and it turns off automatically after awhile, some units will resume at the beginning of the current track, and others (e.g. CZNP) resume exactly where you left off.  If you are playing music, you usually prefer to start the song over again.  For ebooks or long podcasts, I need to resume where it was turned off (like CZNP does), because it is hard to fast-advance back to where you were.3. What kind of accessories can I get?Creative has a set of speakers tailored to the CZNP, and there are many generic accessories that will work with it.  By comparison, there are entire catalogs of accessories tailored for optimal use with an iPod (and may not work with others).  I have what I need, but pine for some things available for iPod only.The best accessory of all is a cable that has a 1/8\" stereo plug (like the headphone plug) on one end, and two RCA plugs on the other.  Plug one of these into the auxiliary or CD input of all the stereos you use, and you can quicly plug this in and play on the speakers.  Such cables are available at Radio Shack and most places selling electronics products.4. How convenient is it to use?MP3 players vary considerably on how easy they are to use.  The iPod is famous for ease of use, though it does not do everything I want to do.  The CZNP has relatively cheap controls that work well enough, and does what I want.  You don't have to be a computer whiz to use it or its software.I have been using it while driving with reasonably good results.  It is easy to pause and start it, turn it off, adjust volume, skip or repeat tracks, back up or move forward in the current track, and small enough to hold in your hand and still be able to hold onto the steering wheel.But if you want to skip to a different album, you have to skip, wait, listen, and skip until you find the first track of the desired album.  Of course there is a menu way of getting there more easily, but you can't use menus while driving.It is small and light. About like a Bic cigarette lighter except twice as wide.  So far I have found the size very convenient; I don't think I would want it any smaller.  But being small, it might be easier to lose - which is why I bought an orange one.5. How long will it last?On Amazon, click the link \"See all ... customer reviews\", then look for the dropdown \"Show:\" and choose \"Lowest review first\" and click the Go button.  There are a number of reports from people who had problems with their CZNP, some bad enough to throw it away.  Some are real problems, others might be a lack of understanding how to use the player.Despite these complaints, the average review is high.  You'll find about the same mix of reviews for most players.I decided to take a chance.  My unit will be well-cared for.  If I have a problem, I'll update this review.6. Can the battery be replaced?CZNP uses an AAA battery which is said to last for 15 hours and can be changed easily.The iPod Nano has a rechargeable battery that is not designed to be replaced, which means the iPod Nano becomes landfill when the battery no longer takes a charge in a couple of years. There will be millions of iPods being thrown away simply because the owner cannot make them continue to work, which has an impact on the environment.  There are now battery replacement kits for iPod, with tools and instructions, so this concern is lessened for DIY people, but most won't bother.7. How does it sound?The CZNP sounds very good to when when I use good earphones like Koss \"The Plug\", or when plugged into a stereo.The free headphones you get with it won't give you the best sound, and you should not judge any player on how it sounds with the included headphones.  Go buy quality earphones for any new player, as this will make a huge improvement in your enjoyment at relatively low cost.8. Does the player use flash memory or hard-disk for storage?CZNP uses flash memory.  Flash memory is more expensive per MB/GB than hard disk memory, and flash memory players are smaller than hard disk players.  I would not want a hard disk, which I think is too heavy and too fragile for a portable player.  Get a hard disk player if you want to carry a lot of content, but make sure you have a backup.  Get a flash memory player if you want to hold the content you will listen to today or this week.9. Does the player have enough memory?I use Highest Quality VBR, which gives me MP3s usually 200-250 KBPS, and I get about 10 hours of MP3 music.  For podcasts or other material recorded at lower quality, you'll get a lot more.  With that much space I can have some new or favorite albums left on the player, and have plenty of room for content that changes (like podcasts).  If you don't use a computer regularly, you might want more memory, maybe even a hard disk, but 1GB is very convenient for my purposes.10. Does the player support gapless playback between tracks?Some albums have music that flows continously from one track to the next.  Examples: Radiohead \"OK Computer\", Dandy Warhols, Moody Blues.  The listening experience is disrupted if the tracks have a gap as the player switches from one track to another.I don't know of any portable MP3 player that offers gapless playback (without Rockbox), though it's bound to come.  The CZNP has a brief gap with no clicks, but it is still somewhat disruptive.  One solution is to rip the album as one continuous track.  The Rockbox open-source technology essentially replaces the firmware on your player, and it features gapless playback.  It is supported on a few players, including some iPods, but not CZNP.11. Does the player require proprietary software or hardware?CZNP includes software, but since it also works like a USB drive, you can manage content with Explorer / Finder if you want to.  All connectors are industry-standard and you can find matching cables in electronics and computer stores.iPod can only load music using iTunes, and other players require software supplied with the unit, or with Windows.  The iPod and others also use proprietary connectors, so replacing a lost cable is more expensive.  I would not be happy with such restrictions. Open standards promote flexibility and interoperability.  On the other hand the iPod is widely supported and it's easy to find compatible accessories.For me, at a minimum, the player needs to look like a USB drive when I connect it to the computer, so that I can load it by dragging files to the player's file system, and the CZNP does that.  I want to have a program automatically create a custom listening program of various short podcasts that play in a particular order to support Radio on Demand, and I want that to happen by simply connecting the device to the computer, with no keyboard or mouse interaction involved.  I have not found such a program, and may have to write it, but I can do that if I want to.  With an iPod I have no choice but to use iTunes (or replace the firmware with Rockbox).  iTunes will not do what I want it to do, and there is no option to use my own or third-party software.12. Is the player file-based or tag-based?The CZNP is file-based: it will play songs in alphabetical order for a given folder.  Naming songs with a two-digit sequence number at the beginning of the filename ensures they play in the correct order.  It also has shuffle play, etc.I had tried the SanDisk Sansa, but returned it because all content is organized and played on the basis of tags, exclusively.  While my music has tags correctly set to play the way I wanted, podcasts don't use tags consistently enough to play them in a particular order that I chose.  With the CZNP you can at least control the order by putting a sequence number at the beginning of each filename.Tag-based may have some advantages over file-based (though not for my uses), but only if all of the content you want to play is properly tagged. is properly tagged"}, {"title": "The right choice", "review_text": "My product research criteria included flash memory, small size, low price, good battery life and compatibility with multiple recorded book formats (I watned a player for unabridged recorded books). 1G memory is large enough for books.

I had no trouble with the software.Downloaded a book and was listening within 30 minutes of opening the package.  A 22 hour book required one battery change.

Blue light on the receiver BLINKS upon every movement of the mouse, which can be distracting to some people but not me.It is definitely good for use with notebook because it is medium-sized, smaller than regular desktop mouse, not tiny though. I've have tried it with desktop's behind USB port too, work perfect.Mouse attracts attention with its Power Saving design, if you don't touch it for a few minutes manufactures claim that it is shuts down. Well may be, but it's hard to test that feature. However, mouse indeed has those mentioned Power Saving metal stripes on its left side, designed to feel user's touch and automatic power on function after hibernation. Besides that mouse has On/Off switch just underneath.It is supplied with a carry pouch, cheap one but still. Comes with 2 AAA alkaline batteries, which surprisingly died in 3 days of use with mouse! So I was \"surprised\" with its monster-battery-consuming capacity! However when I put Sony AAA Ni-MH rechargeable batteries (800 mAh), I they lasted for about a week which is not bad.The battery compartment has a flimsy cover, so you have to be careful during replacement of batteries. The mouse will start glowing blue when batteries come close to ending.Optical precision is not superb (of course it is not like a laser mouse) but definitely MUCH BETTER than of a regular mice.Overall, it is a good mouse for the price. I would recommend it to anyone. Optical USB mice with retractable cords may die over time, it happens when their cord gets worn (Read my other review on SIIG Optical Mouse) but this wireless mouse would last longer and catch attention of your friends. And of course it is good in use.I recommend using rechargeable batteries; otherwise it will be expensive buying alkalines all the time. :)"}, {"title": "DO NOT BUY", "review_text": "I've owned my wireless mouse for almost a year now and can't tell you how many times I've had to change batteries.  I've already changed them 3 times in December.  The mouse uses AAA batteries, so I always have to make a trip to the store.  Not to mention, you have to pry the old batteries out with a knife or some sharp device.  Today I finally had enough;  I threw the mouse into the wall, shattering it into pieces.  I will be sure to buy a new one that has a charger"}, {"title": "Why all the bad reviews?", "review_text": "This thing is great for what it is supposed to do.  It will record from an inline device, like Cassette, Turntable, etc.  Think of old audio and this as another \"new\" recording device like a new casette deck or a \"New\" 8-track recorder (showing my age).It is very limitied in what it does, but what it does works well and is quite simple.The biggest problem I have with it is remembering if I have it on \"record\" or not.  The other problem is also have the record level set up correctly.  Too low and you get nothing and too high and the signal is distorted.  The manual states that it is better to record too low than to record too high and I agree.  I have found that taping the dial to the best setting from the previous time works best so all your recordings from the same type source are all at the same sound level.I then take the USB drive out and connect to my PC and dump the mp3 files or wav files into my hard drive and then edit using Music CD Recorder by databecker.  You can use any audio editing/recording software like cakewalk pro, etc.Gemini has a plus edtion that provides more functions and less \"blind\" type recording, but all in all this little device delivers what it promises.  You can't monitor what you're recording and you can't check it (playback) until you have a PC to connect it to.  I think everyone of the bad reviews are from people who might have expected too much or didn't read and comprehend the directions in the owners manual.I use this at my Karaoke shows to record singers and then later burn a CD of their own singing as a little gift of appreciation for them coming out and helping to draw a crowd (I do this for the \"good\" singers\", not the Scary-oke singers).I set it at mp3 192 kbps and get a full evening of recording with no problems.I've seen this recently for as low as $79.99.  If you don't like blind recording, then wait for the \"PLUS\" version to go on sale.I also see this very useful for people who have a stack of old vinyl that want to QUICKLY transfer 45's to mp3 for their iPODS with little or no hassle and no bother with a computer editing program.It does exactly what I needed it for"}, {"title": "Frustrating waste of money", "review_text": "I have now been through 2 of these.

I have to admit that I have not had good experience with Toshiba products over the last couple of years, but seeing this unit side by side with the competition it was pretty clear which one was going home with me.The only complaint I have is as others have mentioned with the hookups, but maybe I can explain this with a little more clarity. There are ONLY 3 inputs on the back of the chassis: 1) Composite Coax 2) Shared S-Video/RCA Video Audio & 3) Component Connection. That's it for the rear of the TV and that's all most people care about so that means that this Toshiba model is NOT ideal for a primary or Home Theater setup.However, the sharpness of the picture and the depth and clarity of colors will blow you away, especially in \"Color Stream\" mode. This is provided via the component connections. Watching \"The Incredibles\" was a totally new experience on this unit, with some scenes actually appearing in 3-D quality. Same with Son of the Mask. As for the built in speakers, 5Wx2 wont impress many enthusiasts, but this Toshiba sounds great in either standard, BBE, or Surround Mode.This TV is a bar-goon at around $300, and maybe its best feature is that it only weighs 88lbs. so you wont put yourself in traction if your girlfriend decides to upgrade her apartment setup to accomodate a rapidly approaching FOOTBALL SEASON! 5***** for the picture, 4**** for the features, and 3*** for the combo VHS/DVD remote"}, {"title": "Jakob from England doesn't know much......", "review_text": "The cable itself if phenominal.

Past experience has shown me that there is a big difference between the phone brands not just in clarity, range, etc. but in phone shape and comfort against the ear as well. I purchased from Costco three different multiple-phone 5.8 GHz sets to try-out: The Panasonic KX-TG5673 (3 phones and most expensive), Uniden TRU 8885-3HS (3 phones, mid-priced) and the VTech mi6896 (4 phones and the cheapest of the bunch).What I found right away from reading other Amazon reviews and the fine print is that the V-tech uses both 5.8 & 2.4 GHz, so even though I liked the shape and feel of the phones, and the price for four handsets, due to my WiFi interference restrictions, that phone was out of the competition.I liked the look, feel and buttons on the Uniden best, and it seemed to deliver the clearest sound. However, this handset comes with an integrated antenna, and whenever I put my hand around the top of the phone (as its a small handset, its very difficult not to), or rested the phone between my ear and shoulder, the reception became spotty. Even in unobstructed use, the reception was sometimes poor in the room of my house furthest from the base. As much as I liked this phone and its included decent-quality headset, it was out of the competition due to the reception issues.The Panasonic phone, although, as one other reviewer noted, is somewhat ugly with the \"Voice Enhancer\" graphics, performs adequately. The max. volume seem a little low, and the voice tone a little soft, and the buttons not as easy to use with my big hands, but it has an external antenna and I have had no instances of spotty reception. The \"Slow-Talk\" and \"3-color indicator\" features seems somewhat gimmicky and I haven't had a need to try them yet. The set did not come with belt-clips for the handsets or a headset accessory, which is disappointing to me. The voice recorder on the answering machine seems a bit tinny as compared to the Uniden, but again, adequate.Since upgrading to the 5.8 GHz, I haven't had any more dropped calls.

The base station is fairly compact too. 5.8Ghz doesn't static around my wireless laptop or microwave as many people promised. My only real complaint is that the ring tones are limited.

In the setup wizard, I was first prompted to set up an internet connection before using the router. Well, isn't the point of this to get an internet connection?Netgear put an obnoxious red label over the LAN ports telling me to \"STOP\" and use the installation CD. Now I have sticker residue all over the back.

The internet light is still amber!! And what? Only one computer can access the router at a time!!Now I can't even access the router.Well, after an hour of fiddling around with configuration settings, this router is going back to the store.

Thus far, I am very pleased with the model. The 945 is a 4-line phone designed for office use, but it works great as a home phone. It has 16 speed dial buttons located on the right side of the phone. This makes it a snap to call family and friends by just pushing two buttons - one for speakerphone and one for the number. The speakerphone seems to work well and I also like the green backlit lcd display, which generally looks cool but also makes the phone easy to use in the dark. It also displays the date, time, number dialed, and phone call length, useful for keeping track of how long an interesting (or not) conversation has been going on for. Phone preferences can be set by an easy to use on-screen menu system and there are also a bunch of ring tones to choose from, which I appreciate because I have chosen a lower frequency tone that is so much more pleasant than the typical high-pitched annoying telephone ring my last phone had.

I also have cable high speed internet.  Prior to purchasing this camera two days ago, I had a Logitech Orbit and a Philips SB900 web cam running with no problems and a good clear picture with good audio when I did video conferencing through Skype.  I loaded the software that came with the camera, which was Version 10.0.  I started using Skype, and the first thing said to me was the pictured appeared somewhat blurred and the angle was very wide.  I zoomed in some, but since the camera uses digital zoom, the picture became more blurred.  The way to fix the problem was that I had to sit as closely to the desk as possible and lean in a little.  When I did this, I was told that the picture was very clear.  Now the bad - the software supplied with the camera is a RAM hog !!  Part of the problem is that the software (not just the drivers, but the entire suite) used to run the camera is 130MB !!  That is huge (for a USB webcam).  The camera, while running in Skype caused my CPU usage to shoot to 85%.  With the other two cameras it was normally around 25%.  I then went to the Logitech site and downloaded version 10.0.4 of the Orbit MP software.  While it dropped my CPU usage to around 25%-30%, my teleconferencing in Skype was terrible.  The audio was distorted with bad latency, the picture was even worse than before, and my movement was extremely robotic.  Then the worst thing happened...my computer rebooted on its own.  After it rebooted completely, I logged back into Skype and in less that 10 minutes, it rebooted again !!!  Needless to say, I disconnected the camera, uninstalled the software, and took the camera back to the store today.  My recommendation is to stay away from the Orbit MP until Logitech fixes the bugs."}, {"title": "Pretty Cool", "review_text": "I use this mainly for having web conferences.

I needed to buy external 1 GB SD card with faster speed so that i can load whole CA map. Make sure you buy a faster speed SD card otherwise OS will not respond quickly.- You need some time to get used to the way it gives information. for example divice says to take a left turn in 400 feets although it is only 50 feets.- When you are off the route, Device takes atleast 10-15 seconds to recalculate the route and if you continue going in a worng direction, device will keep calculating new route and you will be lost for few minutes.- You need to pay extra $75 to get updated maps from Garmin.

No lockups if you download the patch.", "review_text": "I downloaded the patch and installed and have not had any lockup problems"}, {"title": "unhappy camper", "review_text": "This is one of the poorest electronics gadgets I have ever purchased.  It sounds like it has some very nice features but the programming is so poor that it becomes almost unusable as a GPS.  Before I purchased it I read a review about how difficult it was to download the maps and get them installed. I ignored that review, which was a huge mistake. The Garmin MQue M5 is definitely not user friendly.  For example, I have yet to figure out how to find a location using the map and then plan a route to it.  You have to enter a location as an address and you have to enter it exactly as Garmin has it in its memory, which is not consistant.  The first three times I tried to plan a route with it, it could not find the address I wanted to go to.  Even to my own home.  The base map is wrong, it has my street misnamed, but shows a street with that name where no street exists.  And an email to Garmin to ask what I could do to help correct this error was totally ingnored.And the difficult operation of the unit is the best part of the story.  First of all I payed extra for the next day delivery so that I could take it on a camping trip over the weekend.  It did not arrive until the following week, but I was still charged for next day shipping.  And then when I tried to use it on the 3 week cross-country trip for which I had really purchased it, it quit working on the 3rd day.  It lost contact with the satellites and could never regain contact.  I assumed that it was a software glitch, but there was nothing in the manual about how to reboot it (actually there is not much about anything in the manual).  An attempt to call Garmin on my cell phone was futile because there is alwasy at least a half hour wait to get through, and as soon as you loose cell phone coverage for a second, you have to start over.  It was not until I returned home and was able to spend an hour waiting on line that I got through to customer service and found out that to reboot it, you have to take out the battery pack (which I had tried), then put the cover back on and plug it into the external power supply for a few seconds, then unplug it and put the batteries back in, and then stick a pin into a tiny inconspicuous hole on the bottom and press a reset button.  Now that sure is an intuitive process, which is not in the manual.  Then you have to re-enter everything you ever put in or set on the unit, which is not simple task.  That worked, but the latch on the antenna had broken and the on-off switch did not work properly so I had to send it in to the company for repair anyway.So far, the PDA portion has been OK, but the GPS is a bust.  It gives reasonably good directions once you get a route entered but it is useless to find a nearby resturant or motel because it doesn't show you anything on the map, it just lists the addresses of everything in town.  And what it will show on the map if you zoom way in is wrong about half the time.I thought it was silly to spend $2,000 on a GPS in a car when I could buy this unit and move it from one car to the other.  Poor choice.  I just ordered a new car with a GPS and this unit will become an overpriced PDA, and a rather poor one at that.

The E260 is a nice music and FM radio player, has good sound, and has a decent user interface.  I find it easier to use than the Creative Micro that I used to have.  I do not have problems with the buttons (and I have large fingers), and I find the movable wheel very useful.  The touch sensitive bar on the Creative was too sensitive and difficult to operate.My major use of a MP3 player is during commuting to work.  I listen to the radio above ground and to podcasts and music below ground in the subway.  The E260 is great for both functions -- the FM radio reception is actually quite good, better than my Creative Micro and an older RCA Lyra.The reason that I gave it 4 stars is because the software on the player is missing some functionalities that SanDisk should fix in future Firmware upgrades.  First, it would be nice to return back to the song that you had been listening to before you switch to FM.  The player requires you to go back through the menu steps to find the song again.  It does save what you had chosen before, so all you have to do is press select over and over again.  If it remembers these choices, it would seem a logical step to put you back at the actual song again without the menu steps?  Second, the player is missing a bookmark capability.  This is a big issue if you want to use the player to listen to audio books.  Third, the fast forward only steps forward by 5 seconds or so each push of the fast forward or if you hold it down longer.  The Creative Micro accelerates the speed of the fast forward the longer you hold down the button.  A similar functionality would be nice.  Otherwise, it takes too much effort to advance to where you are in a long podcast or long audio book"}, {"title": "First MP3 player I ever owned and not disappointed", "review_text": "I had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.Like many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it).It came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.It came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.Overall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod"}, {"title": "This product stinks", "review_text": "I dislike ipods so i figure I try something else and hope for the best..Unfortunately I was wrongItunes and Ipods are definitely much better..Basically this device is a cheap piece of crap and it seems like Sandisk's approach is WYSIWYG..disappointingPROS:- long battery life- email tech support is quick and good but website support sucks badCONS:- it's easy to setup but instruction manual is useless- buttons are rigid and miniature and difficult to press with a skin on- wheel is very stiff and offers very little functionality- software is buggy and terrible- freezes occasionally- navigating through menus stutters and lags- boot time is 10 seconds- video mode has no options- needs serious firmware updates- time is listed only in settings menu = useless- tons of issues with playlists getting erased or not working properly- every firmware update erases all your settings, including radio presetsand the list of issues goes on and on...anyone who has reviewed this product positively obviously didnt do a thorough job because these issues exist and its definitely irritatingI am extremely disappointed and will never buy a sandisk player ever againMy suggestion is to try it out thorougly before buying..so you dont make the same mistake I did and trust other people's lopsided reviews.."}, {"title": "OOOOH....Almost there", "review_text": "I have to say I was very pleased with the ease of interfacing and manuevering.

I had it for about a month, and had never freezed.The latest firmware also has custom EQ, which sounds better than those presets, in my opinion. If you high the bass, however, it sounds very distorted. You can reduce that by lowering the second and third bars of the eq. Overall sound quality not very impressive(my other mp3 player, iriver u10, is way better). Still, acceptable and better than the nano's.When you convert videos on the Sandisk media converter, the sound quality is noticably reduced. A very bad thing when you are transfering music videos, but you can mod the program to solve that problem. Just search how by going to the e200 forums in the anythingbutipod website. Photos were easy, but I had to go in rotate all my photos so it will appear full screen on my Sansa. That's time consuming.I think that the mechanical wheel is better than the ipod touch. You can actually feel it scrolling, if you know what I mean. The bad thing is, after exessive use on the wheel, it becomes a little loose and chuggy.I personally have no problem pressing the buttons on the outer side of it(I have small fingers), but if you have thick fingertips, I understand that it will be a little difficult, especially when you have a case put on the player.This one time, I was scared to death when sound was only coming from one side of the headphones. I tried switching headphones, but the problem still remainded. Fortunatly, I was able to fix it by twisting the headphone plug around while it was in the input. I'm still a little wary that it might happen again.I once dropped my device pretty hard on the kitchen floor. Surprisingly, no damage was made externally and internally(still, be careful!)Overall, very good player. I definitly choose it over the ipod nano.I mean you get more battery life, a bigger(and brighter)screen, video playback, fm radio, voice recorder, USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, custom eq, expandable memory..

You'll probably spend quite a bit more money on ink cartridges than the old printer you're replacing.This is what drove me to the HP 7960.  Although it is a discontinued model that was originally introduced in late 2003, it still has amazingly good print quality.  It uses the same cartridges as my old 5550 but the quality is significantly better.  It's helped partially by the addition of a grey photo cartridge to create millions of additional colors.  In addition to its great print quality, the speed is pretty darn good.  It is slightly faster than my old 5500 but at over 20ppm on draft mode, it doesn't really matter any more for me, since I don't print large amounts at a single time.One problem I have had with this printer is that on some text prints, text continues to smudge, despite head cleanings and many test prints.  It is bearable, since it is only a small smudge on the left edge but I'm sure its nothing to worry about.Also, this product is not offered by Amazon but but ant_online.  They do have good service and I got my printer only 4 business days after I ordered it.  Just be warned that you will be charged a $30 shipping fee for it.Overall, this is a great printer, despite its age.  Sometimes, staying with the old is better than jumping for the new"}, {"title": "\"The Rest of the Story\" and Printer Praise", "review_text": "First, I want to tell you, as Paul Harvey would say, \"The Rest of the Story\" regarding Tammy Tenan's (Camano Island, WA USA) review of the HP PhotoSmart 7960 printer.  I work for HP and noticed her poor review of this printer while researching which HP printer to purchase for myself.  I called an internal HP resource and they contacted Tammy and replaced her printer at no charge.  Although there was no excuse for what happened, I hope she is now a satisfied HP customer.  I'll probably never know how this experience affected her view of HP.Second, after doing some through research on this HP printer, I purchased two for my children (18 & 21).  They really enjoy them and love the print quality that the HP 7960 provides.  This is a very quiet printer and has a lot of features that people would enjoy.  Both my kids have HP Digital Cameras (of course) and they can now plug their memory cards into the printer and print direct or copy to their PCs for backup"}, {"title": "Finally, a printer I love!", "review_text": "I can't believe I only paid $130 for this printer.

The company introduced regional coding, which means printer cartridges from one region cannot be used in another. For most this is probably not an issue, for those busily traveling around it is. Also, it is an issue of principle, its bad enough for DVD, but printer cartridges? HP has introduced this rather secretely and if you don't read the box cover etc very carefully, you may not notice. The main issue is in Europe. I got caught out. I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer. I asked for a refund, HP Email Support (US) was nice but ineffective. HP Customer Support (Europe) was snotty and very rude. I think HP does not care about its customers and this cost me over US$75, almost 50% of my printer (my sixth and last HP).

After weeks of communication with HP they determined it needed to be replaced but that my warranty had expired! Evidently your 1 year warranty is actually a 4 month or less warranty! Oh they did offer to send me a \"refurbished\" printer at a cost of another $129 and I would have to send them my broken one at my expense.Needless to say they did not get another $129 of my money! So after 8 months without a printer trying to decide what to do I decided I had to buy another HP photosmart because I had well over $100 worth of ink I had purchased already. So I bought a new HP photosmart online for much cheaper then HP's refurbished one. Guess what? Yep, no light magenta on this one either!I'm not going to bother trying to get support from HP for this second one since they were of no help with the first one. My advise is DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!! HP does not stand behind their product, or at least not this printer. Don't you find it odd that 2 brand new printers would have the very same problem? I sure do! But I find it disgusting that HP does not stand behind their product.Beware, if you buy this printer your doing so at the risk of wasting a lot of time and money like I did.As for print quality, it's great!

For a long time, I considered the bookshelves and bookshelves of space that the collection required a tribute to my musical taste and experiences over the years.  Indeed, the jewel cases just seemed to be an easy way to observe the entire collection and rapidly select the CD that I felt like listening to at the moment.Recently, a friend was over at my apartment and commented that the collection just looked ridiculously unwieldy.  She had made the converstion to the CD wallet years ago and was never going back to the space cluster that jewel cases required.On her recommendation, I ordered the Case Logic 264 CD Wallet (she said that anything larger would be a bit heavy to move around with ease despite the fact that I had so many CDs).  Of course, I should say that I ordered 7 of the cases so as to accomdate the large selection.The only comment that appropriately conveys my sentiment is: WOW!  This is great.  Here's why:1. Shelves and shelves of CD shelving have been cleared/removed and converted into 7 (actually about 6.5) CD wallets.  It's unbelievable how great this feels in a New York City apartment.  It has opened up a bunch of space.2. The Case Logic wallet is extremely well constructed.  Having used a smaller version for the car, I somewhat know what to expect.  THe backing of each insert is soft to ensure that CDs aren't scratched and the plastic that holds the CD in place is nice and secure.  Though some have complained about the plastic binder not being able to open midway/midbook in order to easily reorder pages, it seems a LOT more secure than metal ring binders would be in the long term.3. I opted for the 2 CDs per side rather than the 4 that is potential.  Instead, I put the album liner notes next to each CD.  Though this essentially cuts down by 1/2 the number of CDs each book can hold, it seems more pleasing to the eye and disks are much more easily accessible than having to root around behind liner notes to retrieve disk.  Moreover, the fit seemed much too tight with 4 disks and liner notes per side.  Last, trying to get the CDs out of the sleeves when stored 4 to a side with liner notes was a bit hard and I worried about scratching the CD (some of which are long out of print and prized).4. The koskin case is very nice.  Even though I store the wallets in a cabinet now, I imagine you could leave these on a bookshelf and they would not look like too much of an eyesore.5. Access to the CDs is very easy.  Because the sleeves can be reordered, I stuck with an alphabetic listing for rapid access....sometimes one just has to hear THAT song, right?Basically, this product is a delight.  I know it sounds crazy and a bit overdone, but I legimately freed up tons of space and my concerns over the practicality of these CD wallets has been allayed.  Funny, I actually will need to get an 8th in just a little while.....but it's easier than building another bookshelf.Final rating?  A FIVE (5)"}, {"title": "Garmin i5 - (1) the good; and (2) opportunities for improvemnt", "review_text": "1- The Good) I bought the i5 this past summer.  It exceeded my expectations; it usually does a great job of getting me to my destination and identifying desired stops along the way.  Excellent customer-chosen voice options; excellent graphics; clear screen; clever mounting mechanism.  It's ready-to-go out of the box.  It doesn't speak the street names but I don't find that to be a hinderance.2- Opportunities for Improvement) It isn't 100% regarding US streets.  I live on a street in Virginia that's been here for 15 years, but Garmin thinks I live in uncharted territory.  I took Garmin to Tucson on a recent trip and discovered Garmin doesn't have in its directory the street where my friends live.  (A street that's been there for years.)  I had to tell it to take me to a nearby intersection that I found on MapQuest.Also, Garmin has a really bad time sorting out streets that have directional names in them (West; North; etc.).  For example, if you're looking for \"101 E. Main\" and Garmin's directory contains \"101 E Main\" or \"101 Main St. E\" or \"101 East Main\", you'll draw a blank from Garmin.  By trying alternate representations of the sought-after address I can usually (but not always) find the desired street & address.  Similar problem for addresses on highways.  Is it \"HWY 59\" or \"(state name) HWY 59\" or (state name)-59\" or ???  Only the exact name & spelling will produce a hit.  Garmin would do well to (a) create a standard template for directional streets and highway names; and (b) inform its customers so they don't have to guess at it.Garmin does not provide a good avenue for customer feedback.  Their web site has FAQs if you hunt hard enough, but that's not the same as customer feedback.  And absent customer feedback it's fair to ask how long they think they can stay ahead of a competitor who listens and reacts to its customers' concerns.The upshot of all this: I bought a 2nd i5.

In comparison, the i9900 has been extremely easy to get it to produce fantastic looking prints. I was considering the HP B9180, the Epson 2400 and the new Canon Pro 9000 but the price differential with the i9900 ($289 at Staples, sorry Amazon...) now the printer is being discontinued was hard to pass. The ink is much, much, much cheaper than the 30+ per cartridge for the HP. I am using Epson paper with great results.

Just make sure to let the prints dry out thoroughly as they will smear and transfer ink to glass & plexi-glass even after 10-20 minutes of drying time (glossy photo paper).

Everyone said that this printer is UNBELIEVEABLE so I took a flyer on the recommendations. It was true every time I print a photo with this printer I say to myself or my wife when I show her the photo this printer really is UNBELIEVABLE"}, {"title": "Excellent printer for the money", "review_text": "I know this printer is \"old\" in terms of current technology, but I'm posting this for anyone who is interested in this printer late in 2006.I am a professional photographer and I needed (wanted) a 13x19 printer for a recent extended RV trip. I already own and operate an Epson 9600 and wanted to try a model from either HP or Canon. Epson uses piezo-activated nozzle technology to spray the ink onto paper, while HP and Canon both use thermal-activated technologies to spray the inks. The word on the street is that Epson technique is more accurate than HP's or Canon's and I wanted to see the difference first hand.My subject matter during the trip was landscapes and nature close-ups -- stuff I don't photograph in my studio. My cameras are Canon 1Ds Mark I & II and all digital processing and printing were done through a Mac G4 laptop.Software loaded from the enclosed CD without a problem. I also updated these drivers by downloading the latest from Canon. Updating went with no problems as well. The Canon drivers function perfectly within the Mac's printer driver utility. Heads can be aligned and cleaned, and ink cartridges can be monitored. Paper and page sizes can be accessed correctly from the driver as well.I used Ilford's Classic Pearl inkjet paper, and used their free ICC printer/paper profiles. I printed all images from Photoshop and used its advanced print function to convert colors to the correct ICC printer color space. All prints were made using the highest quality settings available, and thus longer print times.The first print -- which came out in less than two minutes -- was astonishing. Vibrant colors, deep blacks, excellent feathering of highlight detail (no blotchiness). I was hooked. Throughout the trip, I printed over 100 13x19 prints and it is an excellent way to evaluate an image. A laptop monitor just isn't the same as a nice print.Prints require 24 hours to fully dry and are easily smudged when fresh off the printer. The inks are dye-based, not pigments, so they are not \"archival\". The Wilhelm testing site indicates that a print made with these inks will last only 6 to 12 years under normal display conditions.Once back in my studio I evaluated the dot pattern and must say that there is a visible difference when using a 4x loupe for evaluation. At normal viewing distances any difference in the dot pattern between the two technologies is not visible.The only nit pick I have is that the ink cartridges are too small. About every 20 - 30 prints (13\"x19\") depletes one or two cartridges. They are not expensive: $10 each from any Staples or Office Depot. If you buy this printer, be aware that you'll need to replenish the ink supply frequently if you print a lot.For those photographers who work on location and like to provide your clients with non-permanent prints during the job, this is an excellent printer for just that purpose.Easy to use and highly recommended"}, {"title": "After 2 years of use, its STILL a 5 star printer", "review_text": "I've had my i9900 for almost two years now.  I've printed everything from 4x6 glossy prints to 13x19 fine art prints on matte paper.  The short review:  This printer is amazing.  Read on for a longer review.Prior to my Canon i9900 all of my color printers had been Epson.  I became frustrated with Epson's lack of Mac OS X driver support, so when I needed to get a new wide format photo printer I went looking elsewhere.  Review after review praised the i9900.  The review a the Imaging Resource web site by Mike Pasini is what cemented my decision.The first thing that amazed me about the i9900 is its speed.  I thought I accidently left the print driver in \"Draft Mode\" the picture came out so fast.  No, that's really how fast it is even when set to the highest quality print.  In contrast my Epson 1280 seemed like a snail it was so slow.After using the i9900 for about 3 months I realized that I had never needed to clean the print heads.  Cleaning the heads was a weekly adventure with my Epson.  2 years later I still have NOT cleaned the print heads!  I have, however, run the alignment procedure two times.Probably the most impressive feature of the i9900 is its color gamut.  Because it has discrete Green and Red inks it has a wider gamut than many printers out there.Compared to my Epson the i9900 is very frugal with ink.  I printed 20 13x19 prints before I needed to change a cartridge.  Each of the 8 cartridges can be changed individually.  I usually keep one spare of each color on hand since I print very frequently.I primarily use Hahnemuhle Fine Art papers (especially their Matte Photo Rag 188).  The results are truly amazing.  Most people would never realize that the prints are from an ink jet printer.My only wish for this printer is longer lasting prints.  But this really isn't a problem when you consider that a framed print made with Canon's BCI-6 inks will last over 20 years.I would highly recommend this printer, especially as we get closer to the PIXMA Pro 9500's release (early 2007), the price of the i9900 should get even more attractive"}, {"title": "Great if you only want it for a year", "review_text": "I bought this printer and it was great for a year.

I would recommend one thing though... Buy paper for it.  Once you have it running, the supply of paper cannon gives you is only enough for about 5 4x6 photos.

The FM, TV and weather station reception is awesome as well.2.  Also, for those who complain that the headphone jack is mono, please look at the radio.  It has one speaker.  One speaker means that it is a MONO RADIO!  Don't buy a single speaker radio and expect to plug stereo headphones into it and have them work.  If you want a radio with stereo sound, spend more money and buy a stereo radio with two speakers, not a mono radio with one speaker.  Common sense goes a long way folks!3.

My replacement player was a little stickier than the first one but it worked pretty well until its hard drive just crashed for no good after about 9 months. So...as one reviewer said, there are some pretty serious problems with this player, but customer service is OK. I recommend getting the extension of the warranty because you can almost bet that this player will break if you use it much. Despite these problems, the next mp3 player I buy will probably be another creative zen micro, in hopes that the newer models will have worked out the kinks.My much cheaper creative player with a flash drive works way better"}, {"title": "An \"insanely great\" device", "review_text": "I'm one of those people who wondered why anyone would pay big bucks for a GPS Navigation system when a $3 map would do the trick.   The Garmin Nuvi 360 has converted me!  And I continue to be amazed at the power, usefulness and ease of use of this little device.On a recent trip from San Francisco to Vancouver, B.C. I took the Nuvi with me to avoid having to lug a shoebox full of maps.  It took less than 15 minutes from opening the box to having it working in my car.  The mount attaches easily and securely to the windshield, and the device powers up and is ready to use quickly right out of the box.  The interface is well-designed and intuitive.  You really don't need the manual.  Even technophobes will quickly learn how to use most of the features with ease.Entering a destination address is easy and quick.  You simply press letters on a touchscreen keypad to spell out the address.   Usually after just a few keystrokes, the device is smart enough to predict what you are typing and fill in the rest.  Then you simply press a large \"GO!\" box and the device takes over.   It varies the scale of the map so you have the best view of what you need to do next, and it speaks direction commands to you at just the right time.   In my experience, these commands were very accurate and extremely helpful in their specific detail, for example, \"In 50 feet, turn right on Main Street...\"I've read others say that the routing is not always accurate or optimal.  I have not found that to be the case.   In fact, on occasion, the Nuvi has suggested a route that was better than the one I was already familiar with.There is a \"favorite places\" menu which I have found very useful, and the device keeps track of the recent places you've gone, which makes going back to any of them--from anywhere--extremely easy.   Just press the big \"GO HOME!\" button, and wherever you are, the device will guide you home.For longer trips, the device can display a \"dashboard\" with useful and interesting information, like estimated arrival time, length of travel, average speed, etc.   You can also watch your progress on a map which shows   points of interest that are nearby.All this is pretty cool.  But what really sold me on the device was an experience with the restaurant guide feature...I was driving on I-5 in the middle of nowhere and getting hungry.  Just for fun, I decided to see if there were any Chinese restaurants nearby.  With 2-3 keystrokes, the device listed one within 3 miles.  I pressed \"GO\", and it guided me there.   The travel guide feature soon becomes addictive.  It's full of useful points of interest which are simple to locate and select.After mastering the basic features, I experimented with the audio player.  I easily added music and podcast files from a Mac using the supplied USB cable, simply by dragging and dropping MP3 files.  An SD card allows for expanding the memory capacity.  Ok, so it is not an iPod, but if I could have just one device in my car it would be the Nuvi.  My only quibble is that the sound volume seems not to go loud enough, especially if you are driving with a window down, it will be difficult to hear the audio.  Perhaps there is a way to wireless transmit the audio output to an FM channel on your car radio.  If so, that would be a great feature.The unit is about the size of a deck of cards and feels solid.  The screen is sharp and bright enough for most applications, except perhaps in direct sunlight.  It's so useful and portable that I sometimes carry it with me when traveling in unfamiliar areas, and definitely use it in rental cars.  I haven't yet used the bluetooth features, as I need to upgrade my phone first.  But when I do, I expect it will add a whole other dimension to the device's usefulness.In short, this is one of those rare devices (TiVO comes to mind as another) that I never thought I needed, and now that I have it, I can't imagine how I lived without it.   Garmin has really hit a homerun with the Nuvi 360.

It also has individual RGB control, making calibration a breeze.  I am a working photographer, I run a fully calibrated workflow and accuracy is extremely important to me.  So far, I have not seen a print out of a prolab with custom profile that does not closely match what I see on this screen.  Banding is minimal and the color rendition is fantastic.

I decided to upgrade my home phone from my Uniden to this phone because of the range and because this phone included a speaker phone.  Well I can tell you that I have been extremely pleased with my purchase.  The price on this phone is considerably less than I found in Target and Best Buy around my house or anywhere reputable on the Net.  So kudos to Amazon for giving a great product at a great price.  I am not sure why so many others complain about the volume and reception.  I have no problem and I live in Downtown DC. I think the phone is very well designed.  I like the options to turn the ringer off, or to have it on many variable levels of ring volume - not that the ring colors are incorrectly listed - this phone does not have a blue flash.  Also, I can have it flash if I have it on mute to alert me to an incoming call even if I do not want to hear the ringer.  I have normal hearing and I think the call volume is excellent, clear and one of the best I have heard - I have had zero problem with distortion or it being too loud as others claim.  I researched many phones before making this purchase and for price, quality and design I could not be happier.  This is not only a great looking phone but it has many super features that are easy to use out of the box and very practical.  I could not be happier with the quality or the excellent price I received.  I have absolutely no problem walking around the house in various rooms not even close to the base and making a call or continuing a conversation.  Perhaps others are not familiar with portable phones, but I have had enough in my lifetime to appreciate good design and quality when I see it - not to mention that this takes up very little space on my desk.

I agree with all the previous reviews regarding the 60Cx - fast response, nice color display, versatility, etc. I also recommend purchasing the North American package that includes very useful accessories.

For our trip we flew in to Rome, drove to a rural area an hour outside Florence, spent a week there and drove to Florence, then on to Parma, the Loire valley and finally on to Paris. I purchased this unit and the Garmin MapSource European City Navigator v8 [CD-ROM] and offer the following comments.1 - The unit it extremely fast and accurate in identifying location. Often I had coordinates in 20-30 seconds. I believe that this unit was more accurate than the GPS unit in my 2005 Accord. The Garmin unit knows exactly when I am at a turning point, even in Italian cities with narrow streets and 3-4 story buildings on all sides.2 - The ability to load in regional European maps as needed was a big selling point.3 - The download / upload process was relatively pain free and reasonably fast. There is no need to delete the existing maps in the unit before loading a new map in - your upload simply writes over the current maps.4 - The battery life seems to be as advertised. I could run the unit for anywhere from 12 to 20 hours on two standard AA batteries. My rechargable batteries ran 8-12 hours. I will probably purchase the car power cord before my next trip.5 - The turn-by-turn directions were mostly spot on. However there were some places in Italy where I ran in to areas that were recently / currently under construction and in these areas, some wrong turns were indicated. The most useful feature in these circumstances was the automatic recalculation for directions.6 - A couple of small cool items. Heading through the alps we drove through some multi-kilometer tunnels. Even though we lost satellite reception going through the tunnels, the system kept accurate track of actual mileage driven. Also, when you zoom in to a quarter mile radius, the location of restaurants, local attractions, etc show up with useful symbols, sometimes with amusing results. Outside the door of our hotel in Florence I turned on the unit and saw no fewer than 15 pizza symbols (pizzerias) within 2 blocks of our hotel.7 - I deduct one star because of the 64MB limit for downloadable maps. This is room for perhaps 5-8 regional maps. A regional map may cover only a relatively small area - for example you need 4-5 maps to cover Paris. This is not a problem for a person sightseeing around a limited area. However in my case, I needed directions for Parma to Paris. This 640 mile trip required 16-20 regional maps. This meant that I had to reload maps to the unit from my laptop a few times during the trip. More annoyingly, the unit could not plot out a direct trip between Parma and paris with only a subset of the maps, even when I downloaded the 'Route' plotted by my laptop. This meant that I had to tell the unit to pick an intermediary spot along the route, reach that spot and then load in the new maps.This means that a person not traveling with their laptop would be out of luck. It seems to me that they could have used a standard SD or CF card instead of a non-standard 64 MB memory card. Extrapolating from what I was able to do with 64MB, 2 GB would allow you to load in to memory the majority of Europe at one time - Certainly enough for a backpacker on a summer long trip or a group of people on tour with a car. This would be an AMAZING improvement and would make this device practical to a much wider market.Alternatively, it might be useful to change the way that the maps are segmented in the software package. For example, I was forced to load an 8MB map of a small portion of Paris even though I was only in this section for perhaps 2 miles while on a major highway. If I did not load this map, the device could not render a route to the airport.One alternative would be to consolidate some areas together in to fewer maps - the center of Paris can be 2 maps instead of 4 while outlying suburbs can be treated as separate maps. The other option would be to break up some large maps in to smaller sets so that you can be more selective in downloading. For example, I was in the northeast corner of Burgundy for a few miles but I had to load in the entire map segment, comprising 6MB.Hopefully version 9 of the software will offer some option to help solve this problem"}, {"title": "Great unit but WEAK volume", "review_text": "Had to upgrade to the 60Cx from the 60CS due to the larger map file sizes discovered after upgrading to the new City Navigator North America version 8 software.

I rely on the tones to alert me to an upcoming route change, but the volume of the tones is so low, that if you have the stereo on, or are talking on a cell phone, you might not hear the tone. You'd think that Garmin could put a decent speaker in the unit and provide some way to increase or decrease the volume output. Believe it or not the volume of the 60CS was louder than the 60Cx, although still way too weak.This unit smokes, but it's getting only 4 stars from me because Garmin has failed to improve this feature, or lack thereof"}, {"title": "Garmin GPSMap 60Cx", "review_text": "Since I've gotten this product, it's the best upgrade i've done. recommend this to other"}, {"title": "This players meets all my needs", "review_text": "I have been using my Sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures.

The E260 is a nice music and FM radio player, has good sound, and has a decent user interface.  I find it easier to use than the Creative Micro that I used to have.  I do not have problems with the buttons (and I have large fingers), and I find the movable wheel very useful.  The touch sensitive bar on the Creative was too sensitive and difficult to operate.My major use of a MP3 player is during commuting to work.  I listen to the radio above ground and to podcasts and music below ground in the subway.  The E260 is great for both functions -- the FM radio reception is actually quite good, better than my Creative Micro and an older RCA Lyra.The reason that I gave it 4 stars is because the software on the player is missing some functionalities that SanDisk should fix in future Firmware upgrades.  First, it would be nice to return back to the song that you had been listening to before you switch to FM.  The player requires you to go back through the menu steps to find the song again.  It does save what you had chosen before, so all you have to do is press select over and over again.  If it remembers these choices, it would seem a logical step to put you back at the actual song again without the menu steps?  Second, the player is missing a bookmark capability.  This is a big issue if you want to use the player to listen to audio books.  Third, the fast forward only steps forward by 5 seconds or so each push of the fast forward or if you hold it down longer.  The Creative Micro accelerates the speed of the fast forward the longer you hold down the button.  A similar functionality would be nice.

Overall sound quality not very impressive(my other mp3 player, iriver u10, is way better). Still, acceptable and better than the nano's.When you convert videos on the Sandisk media converter, the sound quality is noticably reduced.

I tried switching headphones, but the problem still remainded. Fortunatly, I was able to fix it by twisting the headphone plug around while it was in the input. I'm still a little wary that it might happen again.I once dropped my device pretty hard on the kitchen floor. Surprisingly, no damage was made externally and internally(still, be careful!)Overall, very good player. I definitly choose it over the ipod nano.I mean you get more battery life, a bigger(and brighter)screen, video playback, fm radio, voice recorder, USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, custom eq, expandable memory.. All in half the price. I wouldn't understand why some people would still choose to buy a nano. Because of those people, there are not a lot of accessories for the e2xx(yet).Update: My videos are starting to freeze. It plays for a few seconds, but then turns in to a white screen and the device reboots itslef. It happens very occasionaly though.Also, the player sometimes skips some of my songs.Not a real huge problem, but still, those are some glitches I found."}, {"title": "excellent value for basic needs", "review_text": "All of my MP3 listening needs were being addressed by a set of Grado headphones. However, my young daughter had reached an age where she could play games on nickjr.com or noggin.com.My headphones were awkward on her (and I didn't want her to damage them either), so I needed some basic speakers for simple Game/PC sound.I was surprised how difficult it was to find BASIC speakers these days - instead of a full 2.1 / 5.1 / 7.1 setup. I liked the style of these, and assumed quality would be a gamble at this price point.I've been very pleasantly surprised.Don't get me wrong: if you're looking for audiophile quality @ this price, you are full-on INSANE.I won't be giving up the headphones any time soon, but these are great for the money: sound quality is a little better than you'd get out of a nice laptop, they look slick, and they don't require another A/C adapter.One gripe: the USB, speaker-to-speaker, & audio signal cords are all pretty short...maybe 3', tops.Also, while considering my purchase, I was frustrated that Amazon/etc didn't list any other specs from the box.

Another great thing was that the setup was a sinch, so I was able to print pictures quickly.  Lastly, this model (over the 7850) gives you the option to link the camera directly to the printer or insert your camera's memory card into the front of the printer so that you don't even need a computer.  (There are some editing limitation with this option, but at least there's the option.)  Lastly, there is an extra paper tray for borderless 4x6 photopaper.  Nice.The only complaints I have are that the software is not super intuitive, but I would only dock my rating about a quarter point for that, because the software does offer some nice options like making calendars or brochures, etc.  Also, for great B&W photos, you'd have to buy a third cartridge (though there is a storage space built into the printer for an extra cartridge).Overall, excellent printer for the price"}, {"title": "Nice for the price", "review_text": "Any kid could figure out how to use this, which dosen't say much for us adults.

(at least by their monitoring system) Tired of wasted ink and paper, nozzle cleans, tank changes for 1 low color, etc., I decieded to make the change to Canon and purchased the ip6700D. Setup on my Intel driven Imac was a breeze! Talk about instant gratification! My very first print came out flawless with better resolution and sharpness than any Epson I have owned. I even had to look to see if it was doing anything during printing, unlike the Epson that was only rivaled by the dishwasher for making noise! Individual print setup was also a snap. The quality, paper and other parameters were simple utilizing the supplied software. I found the \"trimming\" capabilities were better and easier than some of my high dollar graphic programs I have. I printed out a box (100) of 4\" x 6\" prints, one after the other and didn't lose 1 sheet from a malfunction of the printer. No head cleaning. no alignments, no getting ready to do a tank change! Nothing but high quality prints. At least the remaining Epson borderless premium glossy paper worked well.I guess I will pass this along as getting wiser with age and not putting up with poor performance again with using an Epson. Why did I wait so long? You won't be dissapointed with the ip6700D."}, {"title": "A Fast, Fine Printing Machine", "review_text": "My setup: Dell Dimension 9100, nVidia 6800, Dell 19\" ultrasharp flat panel, Photoshop Elements 3, Nikon Coolpix 5700 camera. For the initial setup, I inserted the CompactFlash card from the Nikon into the printer and printed a picture on plain paper. This was to determine the printer worked properly out of the box. The results were fine. The 3.5\" display is clear and easy to work with. The printer controls are, for the most part, understandable and easy to use. You could do a lot of printing with this machine without a computer and would need only a minimum of reference to the manual.Next, I setup the software on the computer and connected the printer. The printer does not come with any sample paper, so I used Epson Ultra Premium Glossy paper for the first prints via the computer. The first print was a 4x6 done using software provided by Canon. The results were great and the print was done in about 45 seconds. The next print, on Epson paper, was 8 1/2 by 11 via Elements. The results were as good as the Epson Stylus 320. After this, I got Canon's Photo Paper Pro. Using the highest  quality setting, the longest it took to print was 6 minutes for a borderless 8 1/2 by 11 print (compare with the Epson Stylus 320, which would have taken over 30 minutes for the same job). The print speed slows down in dense areas, so the denser (darker) the photo, the longer it will take to print. You almost need a lobe to see the dots, the printing is that fine. I would rate the results comparable to photo lab quality.Text printing on plain paper is typical of photo inkjet printers. The results are acceptable, but if you really need quality text printing, use a laser printer - not a photo inkjet printer. Photos are what these printers are all about.Paper feed in this printer is agressive and can be a bit disconcerting. I haven't noticed any scoring of the paper, even so, the Canon includes a setting to increase the gap between the rollers and the paper to stop scoring in the event it does occur. Once paper is initially fed into the machine, printing is very quiet.I've heard reports of red cast on Canon's iP6600. This did not happen here. The color balance of the test prints matched the color balance seen on the monitor - and, I did not make any changes to the computer display or inside Photoshop Elements. For other printers, I've had to reprint after making adjustments to get acceptable results. I haven't had to with this printer. This means less waste (paper, ink), which translates to a lower cost of ownership. I would rate this printer 4 1/2 stars if I could, but instead rated it 4. This is because of a couple short comings.1) There is a note in the manual about removing the power plug - \"If the power plug is removed from the wall outlet with the power lamp lit, the printer cannot protect its print heads and may be unable to print.\" If you think about that statement, you can translate it to mean that if there is a power outage while the printer is printing, the printer may not recover from it. Thus, I've plugged this printer into the regulated/battery backed side of my power distribution box, instead of the surge-protection-only side that I would normally expect to use for a printer.2) The software license agreement absolves Canon of any requirement to support the software on the CD. Canon probably does support it to some extend, but legally they are ensuring they don't have to. I can see doing this in regard to any print utility they provide, as it is freeware and you can always use something else, but I do think at least the driver software should be supported - after all, if the driver malfunctions, that would not be a satisfactory situation to a customer.In summary, I am very pleased with this printer"}, {"title": "Pixma iP6700D is the best!!!!", "review_text": "I just received this today.

I knew it couldn't transcribe two voices, but I had read about a workaround where you re-dictate the entire interview in your own voice and then use the voice-to-print software to transcribe it.  That turned out to be a pipe dream, at least for me.  Even with training the Dragon software is not accurate enough for me to make it worth the time.  I will probably find other uses for this software, however.I am still happy with my purchase.  The included sound editing software allows for easy manual transcription because the transcription keys allow you to stop and start the tape (it automatically goes back a few seconds when you restart it) without ever taking your fingers off the keyboard.  I am a doctoral student working on my dissertation, so I appreciate the fact that the sound quality of this recorder is so good, and that transcription is (relatively) painless.  The fact that the recorder capacity is expandable with standard memory sticks is also helpful.  I think that the advantages of this recorder make it worth the difference in price from the lower-end models.  I would recommend taking your time to compare the features of each recorder and its included software before making a decision to purchase a cheaper model, especially if you plan to use this for interviews and focus groups and not just as a voice memo pad.If you are sure that you would never use the Dragon voice-to-print software, you can save a little money and purchase the Sony ICD-MX20, which is identical to this recorder but does not include the Dragon software"}, {"title": "Sony Digital Voice Recorder", "review_text": "I like the recorder and particularly the voice recognition software packaged with this model.

Well, I finally got this and expected to see a significant difference in how well I was playing games like Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, and Guild Wars. Having the ability to create different profiles for each game is a great thing, especially since you can have it load the profile for each game automatically. That is, unless you're using Steam to play CS and DoD, because both games reference the same executable.When it came to creating profiles for the games, the shift states are a nice tool to have at your disposal so long as you learn to use them well. It multiplies the amount of keys that you can assign, but it also cuts away a couple keys for each shift state in order to have each state's toggle key. But that's only if you want to use the different shift states.On the whole, I found the n52 to be pretty well designed, but still a bit lacking. I couldn't create a comfortable profile for a couple games because of how I couldn't get the hang of using the shift states all that well and without them I was lacking a few essential keys. There were no instructions on how to adjust the hand rest included in the package either. I did managed to look up online that you have to actually pull it off though. Pulling it off takes a lot of force, which I wasn't happy about for fears of breaking it, and the different positions aren't of much use to me. The scroll wheel and the top thumb button(the orange one) are pretty stiff and almost require you to shift your hand completely to use them. The thing is built like a brick though, and even while playing it didn't move much unless I wanted it to move. So that is a plus. I give it a 4 out of 5 because it works, its well made, but it has some flaws like the overly stiff buttons and missing instructions on how to adjust the hand rest"}, {"title": "leaves a little room for improvement", "review_text": "this thing is awesome. i use it mainly for battlefield 2 and counter strike source. however, it does have some drawbacks.  the macro tool that makes it so you can put in key combinations is flaky, and you need to set it up just right in order to get it to work properly.  also, it just doesnt have enough buttons in the right spot to make it extremely worthwhile for some games, such as the lack of numbers for purchasing in counter strike, or not enough buttons across the top row for tab, q,w,e,r,and t commands, etc. all these can be gotten used to with enough practice or adjustment, and everythings customizable, so its all in all pretty awesom"}, {"title": "This item does not work with Mac OSX 10.4.X", "review_text": "I bought the item noticing they had support for Mac 10.3+ which should include 10.4.8 since it is greater than 10.3 right ? :)  After having issues getting it to work on OSX, I called up tech support.

I had a horrible time programming the zboard, and didn't feel it enhanced my game experience whatsoever.  I decided to buy this product purely by word of mouth from other gamers who swear by the n52.This controller I have primarily used to play World of Warcraft with.  The two classes I've played it with are a priest and a rogue.The n52 has a lot of buttons and initially feels very clunky.  The buttons were initially stiff, the scroll button is practically useless and the big orange button would move the entire controller unless I held the entire thing down.  This controller initially felt no different than using a regular keyboard and modifying the buttons to your liking.The innovation of this product though is in the software.  You can install and start programming macros, spamming buttons, character templates, and button combinations with ease.  There wasn't any need for me to read the instructions on how to do this; it was that simple.When I played with my rogue I noticed I would down mobs noticably faster since I could spam my combo attacks and finishing moves.  When timed, my overall attack time improved by 1.35 seconds on an even level mob.  I did not try my rogue on a pvp game, just on regular enemies.When I played with my priest, I noticed I could spam spells faster than I ever could before. With the right healing macros in place with the controller macros, I could keep an entire group of people up in battlegrounds and raids with just one button press.  When playing pvp battlegrounds, players on the opposing side ended up targeting me because I was throwing out heals faster than they could terminate the players I was keeping up.  I ended up getting most kills alliance side as well, despite being disc/holy spec (holy priests are known for being squishy).  This is mostly due to being able to spam spells faster than they could heal, or kill me.Actually using the n52 while pvping was at first a challenge because I didn't know how to streamline the macros.  While I initially thought the three buttons available for just my thumb was going to be worthless, I ended using them more than ever.  The big orange button has now become my spam/kill button, the d-pad for targeting, and the space bar-like bottom button for jumping.  After streamlining how I wanted my spells and configuration to be, I was owning at raiding and pvping.There are keyboards out on the market right now that call themselves gamer ones (i.e. Logitech, Microsoft).  They have macro command functions similar to this one, but usually the macro keys are in an akward place on the keyboard. Most people don't use the macro buttons due to their inefficiency.  This controller despite being clunky, is the only one on the market right now that gives you a easy and time-saving method of programming and adjusting macros and keystrokes to what you want.Despite the n52's shortfalls, (stiffness, badly placed scroll button) I have to say that if you are interested in pvp on WoW or any other pvp MMORPG, you should definately look into purchasing this controller.  A lot of the \"legendary\" pvpers are good because they kill quickly and efficiently.  Most people blame great pvpers for being good because of their excellent gear, being a certain class, cheating etc.  All they really do though is use this controller.  It's just that good."}, {"title": "Not just for games", "review_text": "In my line of work I do an awful lot of data entry and when I worked from home, my laptop just wasnt up to the job (lacking a designated numberpad).

This review is about the Nostromo being a SUPERB method of navigating through windows and various programmes.You can map any key to any function or macro, not only that but you can have four different functions for each key (by cycling through \"shift states\"). But what makes the Nostromo a truely excellent bit of kit is that you can have different profiles for each programme and the pad AUTOMATICALLY switches profile when you switch programme.Lets face it, most of the time when using a computer we do the same tasks again and again (go to the same websites, launch the same programmes, enter the same information) with the Nostromo you dont have to go through all the repetition. Just lay your hand in the extreemely comfortable hand rest and hit one button to bring up internet explorer, (nostromo will now recognise you're in a different programme and switch profile accordingly) hit a button to go to your email accout, hit another to enter your login details, hit another button to go to your news website, then another to come to amazon, then another to close your browser.

I knew there would be a cord attached to it ... but I really wished Wacom came up with a completely wireless tablet.

I bought it mainly for use in conjunction with Photoshop CS2, but quickly discovered that its use extended far beyond the scope of a single program.  It was only a matter of days before I packed away my standard optical mouse; and now this tablet is the only pointing device that I use with my computer.  Simply put, I absolutely love it.I use it for digital imaging, graphic design work, digital video editing & FX, and 3D animation.  But on the other end of the spectrum, I also use it for such common everyday tasks as browsing the web, playing music in itunes, and working with Word documents.You won't believe how much time this little device will save you - no matter what you are doing.  It comes packaged with both a pen and a wireless mouse, so you're all set no matter what project lies ahead of you.  I love the programmable buttons and the touch strips on the pad - what a great feature and timesaver!Taks that proved tedious at best with a regular mouse will seem almost TOO easy with this tablet.

The buttons and customizable touch pad are really handy (I keep mine with a \"step back\" function, open apple, shift and space bar).  Oh right, and I'm using a Mac.  Just in case your curious the initial install was immediate (plug and play) though the software added a whole other layer of function!Excellent all around"}, {"title": "The best money you'll spend on an art tool!", "review_text": "My wife recently purchased an Intuos 3 6x8 for me as a gift, and I honestly can't imagine how I ever worked without one of these before.I've been a comic artist and part-time graphic designer for years in the traditional media realm, and have longed to make the jump to digital media for some time. Anyone who has tried (like I have) to create original art in Photoshop, Painter, Illustrator, etc. all know how difficult it can be working with a mouse due to the lack of precise control. The Wacom tablet gives me the precision control I need to really create what I want to, and additional things like the eraser on the grip pen and the hot keys on the tablet itsself only make it easier to do this. The tablet itself is not near as bulky as I expected, and is actually quite light without seeming cheap or flimsy at all. It is aesthetically pleasing, having a clean, slick look that I don't think many of the other tablet offerings have. Working with it at my desk or in my lap is also easy and quite natural. In terms of size, I think the 6x8 allows for excellent control without being too small to work with or too large and overly expensive. Converting over to using a tablet does take getting used to, but experienced artists will feel at home in no time due to the similarity between a traditional pen & paper (or brush and canvas) and the Wacom tablet & grip pen. I am still getting used to the Intuos myself, but it hasn't been a difficult ordeal in the least and has been more pleasure than pain.The documentation that physically comes in the box with the tablet is spartan, mainly just installation instructions and discount ads for third-party vendors. In addition to the driver disk, Wacom also includes a disk of demos and products like Corel Painter and Nik Multimedia Filters, which is pretty cool.The only real drawback of this beautiful product is the price tag. $300 is definitely a lot to spend, especially if you have a limited budget to work with. But with this product, you definitely get what you pay for and I can say that in my case this was some of the best money spent on computer parts/accessories. For a hobbyist, this may be just an expensive toy; but for the professional (or aspiring one), this is an absolute must-have piece of equipment. Once you give in and make the purchase, like me you'll wonder how you ever worked without it and you'll certainly be glad you did.**Update: I recently got together with two friends, both of which are up and coming digital designers like myself. Both of them tried out my Wacom and were so impressed that they each ordered their own the same day! The only difference being that one ordered the 'widescreen' version of my Intuos. This should speak volumes for a product that upon initial interaction they too would take the plunge and purchase one.**"}, {"title": "Great product", "review_text": "Great item, well made! It's a thick sturdy slab of what appears to be abs plastic which house the electronics inside. Somehow this thing detects pen tilt, pressure, and button clicks through the wonder of magnetics. How it does it, I have no clue. The pen itself has a nib, a rocker switch which can emulate 2 buttons, and an 'eraser'.The install was snap. If you get problems with weird behaviour, uninstall any specialty software that comes with your mouse ( Such as AOpen's gaming center ). This gave me a few headaches till I found the problem.The Wacom tablet manager makes customizing a snap. Just bring up the manager, and start the program you want customize mappings in. You can then test out changing systemwide defaults, or 'add' a running program to the manager, and customize settings just for that program. This makes it awesome to use in Silo3D.One minor niggle, is be sure to doublecheck the box when done. I almost missed and threw away the extra nibs as they fell out of the Wacom pen packaging and into the box. The box comes with 1 felt nib ( pencil feel ), 4 replacement plastic nibs ( my least favorite ), and a 'brush' nib which has a internal spring and is silky smooth. It's easy to replace the nibs by gently gripping them with tweezers, and pulling them, and pushing another nib in.The tablet and pen itself take some getting used to, as you draw on the tablet, but have to watch the screen. However, after doodling, I was turning out 'pencil' sketches in Corel Painter essentials.One note, if you are planning on buying Photoshop, or Corel Painter, buy a WACOM first!The Painter Essentials and Photoshop Elements software bundled with the tablet are eligible for the upgrade price for upgrading to the full versions!So for the price of straight out buying Painter or Photoshop, you can get a Wacom, and then pay for the upgrade.

If you're on a tight budget, like I was when I bought them, you probably won't find a better deal. I found them at Walmart for about $15. The biggest downside is the volume control. If you turn them very low, you get a very poor quality sound. Turn them up to about midlevel and it sounds less artificial. You can't turn them up very loud because they quickly reach the distortion point, but they give an ok sound as long as you find the balance. Now, in the level that they work at, they do give a good contrast between high and low dynamics, so just fiddle with them for a while, find that balance, then leave the volume alone and rely on your computer or CD player's volume control.I also am using them for my piano and CD player. Obviously, they don't give as good a sound for those uses as real studio monitors would, but I can have friends in my room and at least they can sort of hear what I'm doing that way. Connected to such equipment, they have to be plugged into the headphone jack, not the line level outputs that you would use for studio monitors.Another drawback to these speakers is that the cables are all wired in. That means you can't just go out and buy longer or shorter cables to meet your needs. Of course, you can buy an extension cable if you are hooking your speakers up a great distance from your computer. In my setup, the computer is on the left, so the cable barely makes it from the computer to the right speaker, which is the one that connects to the computer. But that's a minor thing to deal with. I could flip flop them like some people do, but it bugs me when left and right are reversed. (That comes from playing piano with headphones for so long.) A greater drawback is that the right and left speaker are wired together, so you can only put them about four feet apart. But, four feet is enough to give you a fairly decent stereo experience. As I stated at the beginning of this review, you cannot expect a better deal for under $20.

In my case (see my review on the 5825) the phone would not hang up the line after only 3 months of use.  I had to contact customer service and only because I'm obsessive did I see the thing through in dealing with Vtech support or lack there of.  I'm sure others would have given up early on.  They (Vtech) sure don't make it easy to get them to honor their guarantee.  After all is said and done, my refurbished Vtech phones are going south again.

We were also looking for something with a good answering system.  We got what we were looking for, but experienced other issues that keep me from recommending this phone system.The number one issue, as others have run into, is the batteries - or more appropriately the handsets.  Several months into use, one of the handsets would suddenly show \"CHECK BATTERY\" while still in the cradle.  We assumed that it had something to do with the cradle, so we switched the phones to see if it was the phone or the cradle.  The phone then did the same thing in the other cradle.  We assumed that maybe there was an issue with the sensors at the bottom perhaps not touching, so we adjusted the phone several times and didn't see the message go away.  Finally, after removing the batteries and replacing them, the message went away.We now do this on a weekly basis with both handsets.  It's very frustrating to have a two phone system to hear the one in your room silent and the one in the room on the other side of the house ringing, because yours says \"CHECK BATTERY\".Another annoyance I ran into was the difficult to navigate caller ID system.  The system runs with the phone's \"phonebook\", which saves phone numbers that are in the caller ID for quick use.  With ease, you can scroll through the numbers and select numbers to be placed in your phonebook or delete them, but there is no function to delete multiple numbers all at once.  I don't clear my caller ID after every call, so I end up with a queue of calls in there that I have to annoyingly delete one by one, followed by an annoyingly loud sound each time.The answering system works well - no complaints there.  The signal has been clean too, and with no problems with our wireless network.Overall not a horrible phone, but one annoyance (the caller ID) and one major defect (the handsets) will have me looking elsewhere in the future"}, {"title": "Phone is not worth $75", "review_text": "This phone sucks.

It's a great little switch that's definitely worth the money.  All the ports are in the back, the casing has a brushed aluminum look, and it's fanless, so it's definitely possible to leave it sitting on the desk.  Since the \"switching fabric\" supports 1GB/sec, that means each of the five ports can carry their full 200MB/sec (100MB/sec each way) capacity without problem.  The darn thing doesn't even get warm.  Definitely a good buy (I rate it at 5 stars out of 5).One note:  If I were to buy another switch today, I'd probably go for the 10/100/1000 version of the same switch (the D-Link DGS-1005D).  Darn near every computer sold these days has a Gigabit Ethernet connection built into it.  So, having that switch would most likely let people take advantage of the added speed on their local networks (assuming they had Cat 5e or Cat 6 cabling -- however, it wouldn't make any difference across the internet since only a rare few cable modem even connect at 100Mb/sec and I don't know of any that connect at 1 GB/sec).

They both perform well, and were equally easy to hookup (no software to deal with).  I will add one thing, and that is that the D-Link box was a much nicer design than the Netgear.  First of all, it is much smaller (the picture of the D-Link here is deceiving).  Secondly, the Netgear has the LED lights and the ethernet ports on the same side.

The AT&T phone mentioned above was \"dual frequency\", as were most of the others we checked out at the local big box stores.  Only the Panasonics were 5.8 in both directions.

This leads to more desk clutter and a tendency to get all the wires tangled. The second problem is that I have a small desk fan and if it is on when I'm using the head set, the sound of the fan gets picked up by the microphone and so there's an annoying \"whoosh\" heard by both parties.Overall, the product does what it's supposed to do and is reliable"}, {"title": "Not quite as good as other plantronics equipment", "review_text": "I love plantronics, and have bought more than one product from them.

How I learned my lesson.", "review_text": "I'll start by saying it's generally wise to create a restore point in Windows XP before installing new software.  If you want to experiment with this scanner it's essential.I was able to install the software and get the scanner running.  One little clue to trouble ahead was that on rebooting I had to choose myself as the user.  Control Panel showed that an invisible user had been created.  Anyway, I did get some nice scans of documents and photos.  Detail was very good, but there was a slight magenta cast in photos needing software correction.  Besides more dpi, there was one noticeable improvement over my old HP Scanjet 5300C.  The software of the new 4850 includes threshhold adjustment for one-bit scans.  On scanning plain text that is the adjustment needed to keep too-dark background from turning into black blotches (the default in the 5300) or too-light text from disappearing.Now, the not-so-good.  Scanning slides and negatives is a token feature in this model.  Gorgeously detailed Kodachrome slides can be scanned to cell-phone-camera quality digital images. That's after doing software correction of the color and brightness. The bloated software doesn't save scans to an accessible file until the scan session is closed down.  The older Scanjet could save it directly to Windows Explorer, and the session could be minimized while the file is viewed.At this point I considered it not bad, but not good enough.  I decided to return it to Office Depot, and I might have given the 4850 three stars on the review.  Then I removed the software.  That's when I started getting error messages on bootup and shutdown complaining of missing .dll file.  Fortunately I had a good restore point from a program I put in earlier.  That cured the malfunctions in Windows created by HP's burning-their-bridges software.  That's why I think one star is justified, even though it might otherwise earn a moderate to good rating.I didn't experience the problem others reported of the program freezing at high resolution.  That may be because the decision to upgrade my scanner came after upgrading my computer.  The new computer is probably more tolerant of heavy resource demands than older ones.I'm currently getting used to a new Epson 4490 that I got to replace the HP 4850.

First off, the picture quality is bad.  The resolution of the screen on the phone is low and the picture refreshes about once every 2 seconds or so.  In addition, you cannot continuously monitor a room - the camera shuts off every 10 minutes and has to be \"called again\" to resume monitoring.  If you pick sensor mode (which one would assume you could use to continuously monitor a room), the camera, along with sound, still shuts off, but you get an annoying \"ring\" if the mic in the camera picks up a sound - it doesn't automatically resume audio/video transfer, you have to connect again.  So in short, you can't use this thing as a baby monitor (you'd be up all night reconnecting or responding to ringing), and it wouldn't be particularly good for the elderly either.

It's not like you're not gonna hear anything of the surrounding sounds, but you can hear your music at a much lower level than you'd usually do using a regular pair of headphones. Indeed, if you turn up the volume to a certain level, which is not necessarily high, you wouldn't be able to hear yourself speaking.I've used them in the street, in buses with the radio on, etc. They do a commendable job keeping the noise out. I even tried them when cycling just to check how they'd do.They're not as effective with higher-pitched noises but then again, it's not something that won't let you enjoy your music.The sound is just great. As I said I use them with my ipod and I have no complaint at all. The bass is very strong (you have to keep in mind that not all songs deliver the same level of bass) and the treble's excellent.They work with or without the batteries; when turned off they sound just regular to me: the sound's not bad but nothing out of the ordinary.. but, when you turn them on, there's a whole different story. It's like turning the loudness on. By the way, I personally can't hear any hiss related to the noise cancelling when they're turned on.It's easy to forget how much noise they keep out but the difference is very noticeable right away when I used my previous sony mdr-g57 which I still use for cycling.The cons? They become hot if you're in a hot enviroment since they don't \"breathe\" and the black leather pads hold the heat. In the case of cycling, the wind noise is noticeable.

Those games entertain me greatly.Of course, there's always two sides to most things. And, lo and behold, there are some cons to such a product.Cons:-I found the battery life to be my main one. After reading it can last up to 14 hours and only getting about 4 hours max out of mine, I was a bit dejected but after reading into it more, I realized that is because I do active things on my player such as games and photos. Basically, I guess that's to be expected.-While this isn't necessarily a 'con' as much as it is wishful thinking, I really hoped there would be a sleep timer as I find those especially useful.-I dislike the fact that the only way to charge it is through a computer, unless you pay for an adapter, which I haven't just yet and the fact that one isn't included.-Speaking of connecting to the computer, it doesn't recognize my iPod half the time. When I go to disconnect it, my iTunes freezes and my computer won't eject it. I'm not sure if this is my computer, the player, or both.-On a similar note, my player sometimes gets a mind of it's own. While it's pretty much always cooperative, if it's on a low battery, it takes a while to turn on and when connecting to my computer, it shows various screens and takes about 10 minutes to actually return to normal.-As for scratches, I've really had none, so far. I would still advise you to invest in a case, as the one included is nothing more than a default one. One thing my iPod is prone to is fingerprints. Those little devils like to stick. Seeing as that's not anything major and can be corrected with a case, I let it pass.As many cons as it may look like I've written, I still enjoy my iPod very much and think I made a wise investment. The mechanical glitches I've encountered don't take away from my iPod, just make it, well, a little more interesting at times. I wouldn't trade it for the world. An iPod essentially is for music. It's got that and beyond, and that is why I have found it to be wonderful."}, {"title": "Can't go wrong with it", "review_text": "My ipod is by far the most favorite gadget/accessory I have ever owned. With the Ipod, I can: Listen to music, read notes/books, listen to books, listen to podcasts, view photos, watch TV shows, Movies, commercials, and with the right accesory listen to the radio. I always am impressed with the sound quality and versatility of the ipod wherever I go and whatever I do. The thing syncs so well with I-tunes on your PC or Mac and is so easy to operate and use for anyone who is willing to take a few minutes to learn. I strongly recommend the ipod or a nano to anyone interested in getting an MP3 player because of its ease of use, sound quality, and features that it provides to you. I give it 5 stars because I do not think an mp3 player should be difficult to operate or use these days and the Ipod works so smoothly with Itunes and is easy to use and listen to. However, I will say that a general distaste still stays with me about all the DRM usage rights battle that still exists between Apple, Microsoft, and the rest of the music world in an effort to protect copyrights. I really hope someday in the next few years they can all agree on a file format that will actually allow owners of music to listen to it as many times as they like, on whatever device they may own. But for now, the Ipod works so very well with the i-tunes store and you can convert your WMA non-proected files into MP3 to work in Itunes.The following items I list are ESSENTIAL to have along with your ipod:1) Find a way to listen to it in your car:- this could be either a major installation into your car or a simple 20-50 bucks extra to stream it to your car's radio. The ipod is awesome in the sense that it can allow you to have access to ALL your music while you drive in the car, and thats just awesome if you drive for long periods of time every day or every once in awhile2) Get a AC charger so you do not have to use a computer to charge it- you can buy one of these at a local elecronic store, or order a cheaper one from online, but its necessary when you travel and are away from your computer3) Get the Ipod FM/Radio Remote- this thing is awesome IF you live in a city where there are plenty of radio stations to listen to- its about 50 bucks but its awesome and provides text for each radio station that tells you the name of the song that is playing4) Make sure you get the proper A/V cables that enable you to connect your ipod to your home stereo system- this is a Y cable- witha headhpone line jack on one end, and a white and red RCA input jack on the other- and you connect it to your home stereo on a TV/AUX port - this can work with ANY mp3 player, but its essential to have as most people do not know they can hook up their ipod to their home system for as little as 2-3 dollars at CD QUALITY!5) Get a case for your ipod- this goes especially for those who have the black colored ipod or nano, but still- no matter what color you have, the ipod is SO SMALL and sweet, but you gotta protect it and keep a rubber or plastic case around it. Trust me, it will last a LOT longer and will keep it in good shape because you will not want to lose it. this will not cost you mroe than about 20 bucks and is well worth the investment6) Noise cancelling headphones- these are essential IF you are in a place like an airplane where there is a ton of background noise. Again, this would work with ANY mp3 player but is integral for an ipod owner on a plane for exampleThats all I can think of right now, but overall, the Ipod is awesome. A bit pricey, yes, but well worth the investment, even if you have to get a new one every 2-3 years..."}, {"title": "apple 30 gb", "review_text": "this thing is great, the video resolution is fine, i suggest to anyone to buy this item, im completely satisf"}, {"title": "Fantastic product, just love it", "review_text": "Excellent sound quality, easy to use intuitive controls, lots of space, small enough to take everywhere! just love it and take it everywher"}, {"title": "Music, video and more", "review_text": "I recently purchased a 30G I-Pod Video and thought I would share some thoughts/discoveries. This little thing is turning out to be more than I thought it wasI've been lusting for an I-pod ever since they came out. But somethings always stopped me. The combination of the price/features/size/battery life/etc just put it out of reach. Apple not too long ago release a re-vamped I-pod Video, 30G. My entire music collection is under 6G so I wanted something that would hold it all and then some. I was going to go for new 8G nano but my wife kept pestering me to get the Video instead. It was a toss up mainly on the physical size issue. But I decided that the 30G was slim enough that could handle it.I thought the video feature was a neat gimic. I mean why would I want to watch something on the really small screen vs the computer or my wifes bigger screen PDA. Well she's always got the PDA so that ruled that out. Ok, so I've got 30G's. I can always use it as a portable HD right? More music than I'll ever own and I can use it as a photo wallet.The important thing is that this thing is small enough to fit comfortably in any pocket (the thinness really helps here). The music was a given. No mystery there. Are these MP3's and AAC's true CD quality? No, but after a while I really stop noticing. The hit in quality is well worth the portability. I could either NOT listen to the music where I was (even at home) because of noise/movement issues or I could have this thing wherever I went. Now your life has a soundtrack. Got that song in your head you want to hear, no problem, click away and its going. The \"surprise\" me feature is neat. Just fire it up in a menu and hit play, songs come at you at random. Its an interesting trip when you realize you haven't listened to that song in years, even more interesting when \"where did this come from\" and the even more interesting \"was I drunk when I put that on\" oh wait, I don't drink..Of course the UI is really cool, the way it interfaces with Itunes works well. Main thing is it makes it really easy to create a list of songs for every occasion. Want some going to sleep music, pull 10 mellow tunes into a playlist. Workout music, same thing. Feeling life kind of sucks as you go to bed alone, make a list for that too full of I'm hurtin lyrics. Hit sync and pop, the lists are there and you can scroll through them, look at the list and pick your starting point. They'll run sequentally or randomly, your choice. The UI is what the Ipod is all about.Ok, so I had music down. What about the photos. Well that was a little more frustrating. It really wants to use I-photo to manage them. You can manage them manually but it's a bit of a paid, way too much clicking. So fine, I'll bring some JPGS into Iphoto. Painless enough. Syncs them up pretty good and presto, each album is on there. Scroll through them at rapid speed or hit the slideshow and use a playlist for theme music. Its not a serious photo viewer, more of a wallet. Someone asks how are the kids or what did you do this weekend, don't just tell them, show them. Converted photos (320x240) don't take much space. So yea, the photo feature is kind of cool, has a few uses.So that leaves me scratching my head on the video. Went digging around the net and found some software that would rip DVD's straight to Ipod video format. Poked around and finally got it to work. Slapped a couple of video's (don't take much space) and watched some stuff. Kind of neat, though hardly my preferred method. Quality does take a hit since the screen is so small. Sound is usually better though. I don't think I would use this for \"first run\" watching. But for \"re-run\" type watching its ok. I discovered another use was that you can take it with you anywhere in the house. Putting the baby to sleep, watch your video while your just laying there waiting for them to pass out. Kind of cool. Its also a great thing to have when your \"in line\". Was waiting at the govt office yesterday. I'm number D041 and they are on A012. Oh boy. So I pulled it out and rewatched some stuff. Cool.Unexpected use was as a pacifier. It can (sometimes) be used as a tool to settle the kid down. I've ripped a few of his favorite shows on it but he's real keen on the photo slideshow of his antics.So last night I was on Itunes poking around. You can buy Movies and TV shows, its about 2/3 the price of a DVD for the same material. Not enough to make me bite, I'd rather buy the DVD and then rip it. But they have these little things called podcasts. I've known about podcasts for years but never really paid them much mind. Put now that I had an Ipod...Podcasts can be very cool. They now can be both audio and video. So they are little clips of something. National Geo has some cool stuff. A 15 minute video of the adventures of a seal with a camera attached to it as he swims around. From the discovery Channel I've got a 20 minute audio program on why Europe hates America. Should be interesting. But something that was really cool was the language lessons. Kind of like the usual language on CD, except you don't have 10 CD's to fiddle with, its all one unit. But as really nifty feature on the better ones is that the text of the lesson is there as well. With each of these files (audio or video) you can have text associated with it. So while your listening to the lesson you flick over to that and read along. Its like having the booklet with you. That is really cool when it comes to learning.There are a LOT of podcasts out there. Nova, NPR, BBC and many others put out some programs focused on specific interests. For example \"Today in Medicine...\"kind of stuff. Wow. Theres more than you can listen to and with the Itunes UI its easy enough to get and keep track of. If I spent a lot of time on the road I'd seriously consider the car adaptor and keeping up with the latest in something. Really neat.So if your thinking about an I-pod its really become more than a expensive MP3 player. I think buying music at Itunes is cheap and easy.  If it's a lot of music I'll just spring for the CD. But I don't feel like paying $18 for one good song I hear on the radio and 12 tracks of crap.I'm sure you could do a lot of this with other MP3 players. Having the screen to keep all your info in context is a very nice plus. The UI is brilliant and that video thing is getting to be more than a gimmick.There are a few minor cons-First is no sleep timer. Shut off after X minutes. Accidentally hit play and not realize it until you go to listen again and your battery is dead.I'm still unsure on battery life. I've not timed it but for the 30G its not forever. You can watch a full length movie, probably somewhere between 2.5-3 hours off of a full charge. Mixed use of 4-5 hours seems to take it down to half life, but then the battery life indicator seems to go a little wild at times. I'm guessing a full charge will get you 10-12 hours of audio if you just listen and to spend too much time diving the menus.You've GOT to get some form of scratch protection. You breath on the thing and it scratches. I got the Invisible shield which is a plastic film stick on type protection. You can still use the pod in all the chargers and docks and whatnot. But in the 2 weeks before I got it I managed to get the back scratched a little bit. So make your protection part of your purchase."}, {"title": "iPod Rocks", "review_text": "The Apple iPod is absolutely GREAT!! It is so easy to use and to put songs onto it.

The base station is located on the mid level on the home.Great speaker phone on the handset--I'm using the phone with Vonage and when you have a bunch of voicemails it's nice to be able to use the speakerphone on the handset.

It passed the compatibility test.  The installation worked like a breeze but the monitor output of 2048x780 was less than stellar.  It hurts your eyes.  Also, dialog boxes open across the two screens and that can be a pain too.  Unless you have a graphic chipset with a higher resolution, I would save my money.

I have a library of DivX and Xvid, this plays them all from either CD or DVD! I haven't found, yet, what it doesn't play.2. Easy to get up and running. Interface is a piece of cake.

Burn any AVI to any media and it plays. (any that I've tried, so far.)Improvements? The volume level between VHS and DVD is pretty drastic. VHS is loud, DVD needs volume (but sounds fine).Contrary to another review, the display is fine for me. Easy to see. Maybe they didn't remove that sticky shipping film.

All I wanted was something easy to record my lectures on and this is perfect.  I actually bought one of those cheap-o digital voice recorders first from a big office supply store.  My money was wasted on that piece of junk, which I couldn't return.Positives:--The ipod was completely audible (my professors use microphones, by the way). I couldn't even understand the speaker on the cheap-o recorder.--Using the Ipod, I don't have to worry about not having enough space to record the entire 3 hour lecture (I have 3 of them on my 10gb ipod already, although my ipod was pretty full to start with).--I don't have to worry about replacing and dealing with batteries.  Plus I can transfer the files to my computer and listen to them or share them with classmates and don't have to deal with additional cables/cords, etc.--The software was already loaded on my 3g ipod, it was just invisible in the past.  Super easy.Negatives:--sometimes you can hear the whirring of the ipod thinking in the background on the recording...but I'm only listening for a clear voice; I'm not really looking for sound quality.  I bet if you were recording a concert, you wouldn't be able to hear the whirring.  It doesn't bother me at all, it just demonstrates how sensitive the recording device is.--Sometimes it does take a few seconds to load up and start.  But it's just a few seconds.  It doesn't bother me.--I can't lend out the recorder for classmates when I travel, since I need my ipod.

It's designed to be quite sensitive but that often leads to distorted recordings, especially if you have to try to record someone over speakerphone. If you don't press record within a few seconds of plugging in the unit, the iPod goes to sleep and you've got to do the two-finger reboot, which is inconvenient and might cost you the beginning of your interview. And I, too, have heard some hard disk access noise on some of my recordings. (I haven't had issues where it failed to record at all--not yet, anyway.)However, those issues have been minor compared to the hassle this little unit has saved me. As a journalist, I've used this for a year to record interviews on my 3G iPod and found it to be a lifesaver--it's much more convenient than using a tape recorder, and I can record for well over an hour without worrying about running out of tape (just this past week, I recorded four hours of interviews almost non-stop, then recharged my iPod that night and did it again the next day). The microphone works well if you're in a room full of people and you cannot place the recorder in front of any one person--just stick it in the middle of the table and you'll get everybody, as long as they don't scream or mumble (same issue as tape, really). And since the recordings save as 8-bit, 8K WAV files, they're easily burned to disc for archiving and/or handing off for transcription.This is not designed to record music or anything with great dynamic range. It is, as its title states, a voice recorder, so if you're looking for something with high fidelity, don't buy it. For dictating notes to yourself or recording conversations like I do, it works quite well.I guess my experience has been fortunate, because I can't complain as much as many other users--but I'd also be interested in an improved model with the features others have mentioned they'd like. A jack for an external microphone, some sort of attenuation control...an on-screen meter to monitor the input level would be extremely helpful.

I will say, though, that the firmware was somewhat backlevel, though it was very easy to update.As for actual use, it has great features, very good sensitivity, and it's *really* light. The last one I had that was this light was the Garmin Quest, which I got rid of since it was so annoying to be continually reloading maps. Anyway, if you want the best, this is it.

When this first happened, I thought the Nuvi had died, but after charging the battery, it revived.  Initially I thought this flaw might be unique to my Nuvi, but I saw this complaint in a couple of other reviews.  This is a serious flaw, since it necessitates having backup plans (i.e., MapQuest printouts) in case the battery fails.  Again, this Nuvi battery failure happens while it is connected to the car battery, so you are dead in the water until you can find a plug and recharge the Nuvi for a few hours.

As a Certified Occupational Hearing Conservationist what I like most is the NRR (noise reduction rating).  Whether it's the reusable flanged pieces or the foam, they work to block out background noise better than any other earphone I've found.  Why is that good?  It means you don't need to push up the volume on the player as much to hear the music, which means you cause less damage to your ears.  I use mine every day on the train, even when my iPod isn't on.  The reusable tips use the same design and material as reusable ear plugs made by companies like Moldex and the tips, both flanged and foam, come in two different sizes for better fit (3 sizes would be better).The Bad.  The sound reproduction isn't as true as the ER6, even the charts on Etymotic's website show that.  Of course if you wanted true reproduction you wouldn't be listening to an mp3 player would you?  I think the reproduction is good enough, unless you live for heavy bass.The reusable tips take a little getting used to.  When they're new the rubber can feel uncomfortable, they itch in my ears.  Eventually, over a few days (maybe 4-6 hours) of wearing them, the natural oils in the ear penetrate the rubber and every thing feels fine (I replace my flanges every 4 months so I have to relive it every time).The Ugly.  I've had 2 pairs now, and both of them have had problems with the plug, specifically, the wires separated from the plug, leaving me with no sound (I know it's not wax on the filter, by manipulating the cord I can get the sound back).  If you're good about taking care of your earphones, this might not be a problem, but if you're like me, and just wind the cord around the iPod and through the whole thing into in a backpack, these may not be the right earphones for you.Bottom-line.  If you treat your earphone well and bass isn't the end-all and be-all of your listening, I highly recommend these."}, {"title": "Don't Believe the Hype!", "review_text": "First off, I need to say that I realize these earphones must be inserted well into the ear canal to achieve optimum bass--I GET IT! My problem is, the bass response still isnt that great. Yeah you notice certain sounds moreso than in other earphones, but these are just the ones in the upper mid to high range. Again, I must reiterate: Bass is compromised.They are also, in my opinion, extremely uncomfortable. You have to really jam them inside to get any kind of bass, and my ears tend to ache slightly within minutes. To be fair, they do offer to send you smaller plugs, which I havent tried.I have to wonder how many of the 5 star reviewers actually tried other in-ear headphones. The overall concept is very effective and a switch to ANY in-ear headphones from standard ear-buds, or over the ear headphones will be substantially greater than what you are used to. I just feel that this particular pair don't perform as well as other cheaper models.I have a pair of Sony MDR-EX71 and they are ONE FIFTH the price of these earphones. The bass is MUCH better although the mids and highs aren't quite as bright. I've been going back and forth comparing both tonight and I have to say, Sony wins based on bass, comfort, and price.

Recently I was introduced to Sennheiser and I have to say that in some respects they produce a much better product.  The Koss UR40's that arrived at my home were complete with scratches inside the packaging.  In my opinion, Koss showed no concern for a customer by sending out an item that looked like it was second-hand instead of brand-new in the package.  They claim that these are sound isolating headphones.  They do not isolate any sound at all.  Don't you believe it if anyone says otherwise please.  And as to sound quality, the Koss PortaPro and KTXPRO1 as well as the Sennheiser PX-100 and 200 all do a far superior job.  As to comfort, I will say that is the only reason these headphones did not receive one star.  They are comfortable and they don't overheat you either in my opinion.  But they do not do what they were advertised as being able to do such as sound isolation.  The Sennheiser PX-200 cancels out a lot of ambient sound and they are not circumaural (Over-Ear) headphones.  This is one Koss product I will not keep; they falsely advertise many of its \"virtues\" and they man-handled mine in the packaging phase.  I still recommend Koss but I do not recommend this model.  Also, even though they claim to be able to handle both home and portable systems, I needed my handy Boostaroo (great product!) to adequately hear them and with my home system, they were underpowered and had no real sound quality (I think \"dull\" is the best word I can use) no matter how much power was pushed through them and yet portable headphones such as I have mentioned worked awesome at way lower volumes!  Perhaps mine were defective but I rather think that they simply are a pathetic attempt at making a comfortable Circumaural headphone.

I read a lot of reviews, so I figured since I purchased these I'd give something back. But since I like to keep things organized, I won't jumble my thoughts; I'll put them in categories rated out of 5.Sound Quality: 4.5- Good, gets the job done fine. The sound has a definite bass and strong enough mids and highs for me. Switching to these from the simple Philips ones that came with my cd player was a big change, the difference was clearcut, simply a lot nicer. They work well with my mp3 player and my computer, though I can only assume they would work well with a cd player, since I never use it anymore. They may not be true audiophile headphones, but nobody should be complaining with the sound from these, only nitpicking.Durability: 2.5- Average, they aren't the most durable things out there, but they certainly aren't destined to break either. The hinges and plastic parts I could see snapping if abused, but if you aren't careless you should be fine. The cord is thin and seems to be more fragile than some others, that could be its most fragile part, and not easily fixed if broken. I tend to be pretty gentle with my stuff, so the durability issue wasn't a problem for me.Portability: 5- I gave these a 5 because among large headphones, these are probably the most portable given the convenient fold up option and short cable length. They are incredibly light too, making them extra convenient for travel.Isolation: 2- Isolation is not the strong point of these headphones. It's a given that since they cover the ears they block a bit of sound. But you can hear people and/or they can hear your music depending on how loud the volume is. Definately not the perfect choice for airplanes, if isolation is mainly what you're looking for. I didn't care because I was mainly using them for up in my room at my computer, so isolation didn't matter much.Comfort: 5- This is another area these headphone shine. I could go to sleep with these headphones, wear them for days without much of a problem. Adjustibility is a big plus, because not everyone has the same size head. Obviously ears get a little warm when covered by the phones, but not bad, not like ear mufflers.Looks: 4- It's a given big headphones are not very stylish, but compared to others, these look pretty good, with the silver outside. I would consider wearing them in public, depending on the circumstance. But of course, this is all personal opinion.Overall: 4 (Ok, 3.83 but I rounded up)-Pros: Good overall headphones with good sound and great comfort. Works with a wide range of hardware. Very portable.Cons:Will need an extension cable for home use. Fragile to the careless user. Not very isolating.Ok I've said enough, now you decide"}, {"title": "Tops in sound, comfort, and convenience.", "review_text": "These have quickly become my favorite headphones for use at home or at the station.  Compared to Koss' comparably priced TD80's or TD85's, the UR40's are lighter, more compact, and less loose-fitting but without the slight pinching of my Sennheiser HD497's.  The sound is fuller than Koss' heavier TD series, practically indistinguishable from the Sennheiser's or my Sony MDR600's--balanced, with tight, definitive bass, crisp percussion, pleasant and very present mid-range.  Moreover, their high efficiency should make them more practical than the Sennheisers for underpowered portable players.  (Also, with low-efficiency headphones such as my Sennheisers, increasing the gain occasionally produces feedback when working in front of a microphone.  The high efficiency and the sealed cups of the UR40's eliminate feedback problems and moreover don't broadcast audio signals to other people in the user's vincinity.)The UR40's are lighter and more compact than the picture might suggest.  The cord is short (a plus from my perspective) and exceptionally thin (adds to the lightness of the package).  These are \"pack and go\" phones, especially handy for people on the run--no wasted time folding them, or re-packing them into a case or tote bag.  Just collapse 'em and wedge 'em into a spare corner of your brief case or coat pocket.I can't attest as yet to workmanship quality.  I suspect that should you forget yourself and walk away from the short tether too quickly (I lost a favorite pair of Panasonics that way) these will not be forgiving phones.  A lot of plastic, and it's pretty much all or nothing if you break something.  But for the convenience plus the sound and the modest price, any use beyond a year might be considered gravy."}, {"title": "Excellent open-air headphones", "review_text": "I currently own Grado RS-1, Koss Pro-3AA and Koss UR40 headphones.

I'm not a huge audiophile, but I do expect much better sound than built-in computer speakers can deliver, and as I sometimes spend 12+ hours working at my computer, I needed something that wasn't going to be torture on my ears/head.  I have a very small head, so I wanted the self-adjusting strap to keep them snug and comfy, and of course the fact they're collapsible makes them easier to transport.These headphones have more than lived up to my expectatoins, and I'd buy them again in a heartbeat, but I do have a couple of warnings for those considering buying them.  One is the short cord (4 feet), which works pretty well as long as you're not interested in moving around too much, and your headphone jack is reasonably close.  You're probably not going to be able to plug them into the back of a computer tower or watch TV with them without an extension.  The other thing is that after about a year they started to look really shabby.  The silver paint on the outside is scraping off, and the outer lining on the earpads has mostly torn away.  They still work and wear fine, though, so as long as you don't care how they look it's not a huge problem"}, {"title": "Great armband!", "review_text": "I think this armband has worked great for me for the last year.

Since I'm using company money, I figured why not get a nice keyboard since I felt that my old wireless keyboard and mouse lagged a little bit.  I thought to myself,  I wanted my next one to be as precise as they can come!  So I put this order together with the PC.And boy was that a mistake!This got to our office a few days before the PC came in, I liked the styling and I was so excited to use it, so the moment the PC got delivered, I was raring to go.  It worked without installing the drivers and I went immediately online as soon as I got the PC hooked up.  I read the reviews and was wondering why other users here gave this wireless combo such bad reviews.  I didn't pay attention to the other reviewers and proceeded to install the drivers... and that's where my frustration all started.  After several crashes, unwanted reboots and driver installation restarts... I was able to somehow get lucky and install and actually finish the software installation process.  The LCD screen kinda impressed me and I even thought to myself how this is all going to be great.  Upon using the keyboard and mouse more, however, I find that I'm agreeing with with most of the comments left for this poor attempt for a bluetooth combo.  Keys are responsive enough and I like the solid feel, but when you leave it for a minute or two, say you were doing something with your mouse and you suddenly type a command, your keyboard tends to ssssttttuuuuttteerrr... then ofcourse you press enter and the command does not work, which can be very irritating especially when your working with CAD applications.  You wonder why your command didnt go thru then you read on the command prompt that you typed SST instead of ST.Now the mouse!  I used to laugh about one of the comments in here where the reviewer complained how the mouse tend to get REALLY slow when it decides to, I even thought that whoever that was who wrote about that must be using a really slow PC which tends to freeze and affect the mouse's speed.  WRONG!  It does happen, and it happens alot!  I have a dual core PC with 1 GB Ram and 256MB Graphics Card and I often feel like I'm dragging a cursor that's tied down by bricks!  Did anyone say carpal tunnel ?  I think I can FEEL it!  The funny thing is that, well, it really is not funny but this happens even if you only have ONE applicatoin running.  Believe me I gave this mouse a chance and closed all of my other applications and just stayed on Photoshop thinking that will solve my \"slow mo-use\" issue but my cursor still behaved erratically with only ONE app running!  It works so bad that I couldn't even find where my cursor was at times!  the left and right mousewheel is worthless too! especially when you use the middle button function a lot for 'panning' around.  Good thing I can disable the left and right function.SIGH!!! One good point though is that the bluetooth hub works and I am able to connect my phone to my PC... Mouse and keyboard wise though, you can do better.  Infact, when I got this, I ordered a Logitech Cordless Desktop S510 with Media Remote for my desktop at home and I never had a problem with that!

I finally gave up and switched over to Comcast voice.  It's a little more expensive, but the problem is gone overnight.Here's the kicker:  The day after I switched to Comcast voice, Vonage pinged my credit card for another month's billing.

Trading in a $50 a month bill for local, then another $20 a month for international calling, for unlimited long and local toll calling not to mention a free international plan, and all for less than $30 a month, well, who wouldn't. So we did!BIG MISTAKE!! First of all customer service stinks. We were told that we could keep our local number, only to find out after 2 agonizing months of waiting that Vonage couldn't port the number after all (all the while we still paid for our local bill so that we still had the local number we were trying to transfer). Vonage did nothing but point fingers at everyone but themselves, and when they finally did admit that they couldn't do it they tried to put it on us. Almost every time we called, and it was many, we usually ended up with someone out of the country. On top of that we had horrible phone service. No one could hear us and there was an echo that would come and go. There was nothing Vonage could do to fix it and blamed it on our broadband service which had always functioned perfectly for us.We tried for 3 months to work things out with them when we decided to cancel. Here is the great part....THEY CHARGE AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE OF $39.99 if you stop using them within a 12 month period after you sign up. Then they stuck us with a $50 charge on \"rebate\" we supposedly got when we bought a wireless router through them. To avoid that charge we had to wait for our 3 full month to finish which meant that we would be charged another month's fees. None of these charges were mentioned at the time we signed up. NON DISCLOSURE is their sneak attack.Needless to say, to get shut of the company we had to shell out over $70. NOT GOOD!!!!Our advice, stay as far away from them as possible. VOIP is not federally regulated and so when they do this to you, you have no recourse, no way to protect yourself.

Comcast is the only internet provider in my area and hence I no longer broadband connection.  Hence the Vonage service became useless and I called to cancel service.  My horrible experience with Vonage started here.I had to wait 35 minutes to get a customer rep online.  The rep asked me the reason why I am cancelling.  When I explained the reason he made fun of me saying I must be crazy to cancel broadband and go for dialup which is history.  Will his father pay the 65$ for the broadband?  I wanted to ask but did not.  To my horror, the rep said that I have to pay 40$ cancellation fee as I was not a customer for an year.  This is crazy.  When I revolted he said that it is mentioned in one of the fine-prints and offered me to send an URL to my email id.  I finally ended up paying 40$ to cancel their service.If a landline company charges cancellation fees it is understandable as they have done some manaul work to provide and disconnect service.

I really was surprised, however, when I actually ended up needing to use it for just that purpose.  We were without power for a full week (and that was lucky!) and was grateful to have the fan (some others in the region will be without for as much as three weeks! and the weather is warming back up a little... they will be wishing they'd bought one of these).  It's simply amazing the amount of pure joy and relief one gets when the power comes back on!It seems to be a fairly good quality fan, though not particularly robust (in some ways it seems a little delicate, such as the plastic switch and battery compartment cover--but nothing has failed in any way).  It provides a fairly full breeze, though perhaps considerably less than half what an AC powered fan of similar size would provide (still it was easily enough to allow me to sleep, even on low setting).  It makes a reasonable hum on low with fresh batteries, almost a little noisy on high--however, before long the batteries will weaken and the hum is hardly noticeable).  It opens like a book with one side, the base, heavy with batteries, so it's quite stable where it sits.  This fan in some ways though, is not a small one.  It's around a foot wide (11.5in)--so the U shaped base will require a modest open space (11.5x8in) (probably only packrats like me would even notice that) to put it.  The way it folds opens allows you to adjust the angle (up/down), which I did find useful.The only real problem with the fan is that it is not cheap to run.  I found battery prices on store brand D cells to run around a dollar each (give or take, and your mileage may vary).  It may indeed still be running after the quoted 24 hours, but just barely.  While using it somehwere around half the day (and night), I did have to change out the batteries on the second day--so the claim isn't far off).  However, when you actually change EIGHT D cells, you realize how much battery that really is.  Plus, if you find yourself without power for an indefinite period of time (such as following a natural disaster), you'll be trying to use it sparingly as you look at your now precious and limited supply of batteries (say 4 sets at $32).  After several days, you'll think it really eats batteries and you might find, as I did, that even once most stores have reopened, there isn't a single D cell battery to be found.  My usage ended up being about $4 to $6 a day, and when doing without power that doesn't seem so bad (however, had it been hot like last year, I'd have been using twice that running it all the time--possibly on high--and I would have run out of batteries... such a stock would have required at least $80, and more likely $120 or more--just for 10 days).I considered rechargeable D cell batteries and a solar charger, but found the prices in the neighborhood of $10 each, which would be an $80 option--without the charger.  However, very conveniently, it does have an external power socket for 12V--so if you get an adapter cord and have a spare car battery or portable battery package it could be a handy way to run it for longer periods (of course, it would easily work fine in the car with the appropriate lighter plug adapter cord, except that it's relatively large and would really need it's own open seat).  I wish they had a rechargeable version with an external battery pack option.Overall, I think a single person could probably get by with a smaller, less powerful (and consumptive) fan--but it did provide  a very comfortable amount of air (useful even when the temperatures didn't reach uncomfortable levels--and seemed well worth the cost).  To provide a light breeze for a larger area such as for a whole sofa or queen bed, this is a good way to go (just buy a considerably stock of batteries).  Alas, I can't imagine much use for it short of power outages or camping.  The best bet would be to have both this fan and a smaller one and use them as required."}, {"title": "Awesome Sound = Bose", "review_text": "This are excellent speakers, the quality is remarkable.

The partition dividing the two zipped compartments doesn't connect to the bottom of the bag, meaning papers and books and notebooks sometimes slip through.

There is a flimsy fabric pocket opposite the laptop sieve that my books keep getting caught on.  It's not a big deal but annoying nonetheless.4.

The Panasonic let me go out about 40 feet before I could hear it stregthen the signal I walked another 30 feet and it got a little fuzzy.  After all my walking, I got about 100 feet away before it started to get really fuzzy.It comes with 1 base and 2 charging stations that only have electric plugs.

I'm very favorably impressed so far with the voice clarity incoming and outgoing.  However, like many other cordless phones that I have owned, the outgoing volume is a notch lower than my corded phone, and using a headset lowers it even more.Range is adequate for most uses.  There seem to be contradictory claims about these higher frequency phones.  I think the tests that show higher range for 5.8 GHz or 2.4 GHz compared to 900 MHz were probably done with an unobstructed path between the base and the handset.  In the real world the superior penetration of 900 MHz DSS has made it the distance champ. I can use the Uniden 5.8 GHz out to my apartment mailbox, but if I had to continue a call to the laundry room, I would need to grab my old 900MHz DSS Sony Hi-Power.The phonebook is nice, and I especially like that it can be copied to additional handsets. My deceased Siemens 2410 2.4GHz DSS could not do that. It looks like it cannot be copied from handset to the base unit.  It would therefore be best to first enter your numbers into the base unit, from which they can be copied to the handset(s).Edit to above:After I bought an extra handset I found that I can copy phonebook entries from handset to base.

I really like the orange-red light.  Nothing outside of Uniden looks any better. And like many who thought this phone would be the size of an office phone, I was shocked to find out how compact this thing actually is.  Even the box it came in was tiny.  Just to put things into perspective, the handset dimensions are roughly 2\"x6\"x1.25.\"  It fits perfectly in my hands. The keys on the base are a bit bigger than the handset's. It was fine for me.I live in a basement and signal is fine through the sheetrock walls.  To test the range to its limit I went outside and compared it to an old Panasonic 900 MHz phone. I found that the Uniden cut signal 10 yards short of the Panasonic.  I had no problems with that but it sure makes me wonder if higher frequencies truly benefits the phone's range capability.Many complain and scratch their heads as to why a 900 MHz phone had better range than some 5.8 GHz phones.  Store clerks aren't any better in shedding light on the matter and only help to confuse customers with numbers.  I've heard them tell a customer a higher number means better security and range.  Rather vague explanation if you ask me.While it's technically true that a 5.8 GHz phone would have a longer range than a 900 MHz phone due to the efficiency of shorter wavelength, it is not always the case in practice.  You also have to consider antenna size and the transmitters power output. A strong transmitter on a low frequency will have better range than a relatively weaker transmitter on a higher frequency.  I guess different cordless phones use different combinations of these factors.Higher frequency doesn't mean it's more secure either.  It's the digitization/encryption of the signal that helps to make a cordless phone more safer as opposed to analog.  And then there's DSS or digital spread spectrum or frequency hopping that kicks the security up a notch.  This is the information the store clerks don't tell customers or they don't know it themselves.Back to my review.  The digital recorder is top-notch.  I don't hear compression artifacts like with another answering machine I used to have. The compression was so bad that it was hard to make out the message sometimes.  This Uniden phone got the compression ratio just right.So what could this phone improve on?  I wish the base ringer can be turned down even lower.  It can only be set to High, Low and Off.  The Low setting is equivalent to Mid ringer setting of the handset.  Other than that I love everything about this phone.These are just my initial impressions. I've had the phone a few days.

Its screen size and quality are unmatched and the features included in such a small package are incredible.The 10.2 inch screen is arguably the best thing about the DVD player.  The LCD features a crisp display and offers amazing clarity.  The Philips PET1002 has the best display of any portable DVD player that I have ever seen and will not disappoint.Philips claims up to 5 hours of battery life and, while I didn't get that much, I did get a little over 4.5.  Not bad for a portable DVD player with a 10.2 inch screen.  Extra batteries are available to order directly from Philips if you require more juice on the go.What really sets this portable apart from the competition are the DVD player's included extra features,  my favorite of which is the DVD player's ability to output video via *included* component video cable.  If you have a TV with component inputs, this will allow you to connect the Philips PET1002 and watch a video in 480p.(The device also comes with a regular RCA cable and an S-Video cable for use with \"older\" television sets.)The built-in speakers of the PET1002 are like those of any other portable DVD player: quiet and forgettable.  I always use the DVD player with noise-canceling headphones (I recommend the Shure E2C or E3C personally) anyway so this doesn't really bother me, but this may annoy some users.Unfortunately, the Philips PET1002 is not without it flaws and setbacks.  The most annoying is the unit's loud DVD drive.  After inserting a disc and waiting for it to load, the DVD player sounds like a jet taking off from a runway.  Fortunately, I only notice the noise when first loading a disc, and not while a DVD is playing.  A minor setback, but annoying nontheless.Also cumbersome is the power adapter.  It seems that companies spend a lot of time developing a great product but shortchange with the power cords.  The power adapter is bulky at the end, which makes it difficult to plug into a wall or surge protector that has more than one thing already plugged into it.  The added bulk also makes packing the power adapter more of a challenge.  I wish it had been designed more like Apple's laptop power adapters.Despite these two frustrating hindrances, the PET1002 is well worth the money and beats anything else currently on the market.  Highly recommended.PROS:-----1.) Best screen quality of any portable DVD player out there2.) Component video out (480i or 480p)3.) Includes remote, carrying case, automobile case (for \"mounting\" the DVD player on a seat) and car power adapter4.) Good battery lifeCONS-----1.) DVD drive is loud when first loading a DVD2.)

No more carrying a lot of DVDs into restaurants or on flights.  Others have complained about the manual and the speakers.This is a great DVD player and the quality of it outweights the manual or speakers.  This is a PORTABLE DVD player and made to listen through the headphones, not an entertainment player for the house.Try connecting your Ipod  or any other portable players into a speaker without amplifier, the outcome is poor quality.  It's like using my MP3 capable cell phone as a home stereo.As for the manual, who needs it! All the icons for the player is the same as  all VCR, Stereos, etc.  The icons they use on the buttons have been used for more than 40 years.

The map displays visual directions in large letters, but they don't give helpful tips such as \"stay to the left\" like the verbal prompts, and of course there is the obvious danger of driving while watching a display.The one greatest advantage of an electronic nav system over a paper map is that the GPS continually updates your position so that however lost you may be, the prompt will always attempt to direct you to your destination."}, {"title": "phenomenal", "review_text": "If you love to travel like us, you would like this product, it's tell you point by point were you go and were you need to stop.

I've never had a problem with it, I've rarely ever had lag issues, or performance issues of any kind.Sometimes there is a bit of an echo in the speakers, but it's not so much that you can't get over it.All in all this is a great product that produces a VERY clear picture if there is enough light. Also, the filter on it for brightening in low light situations is very good. I'd recommend it to anyone. It fits snugly, but securely on the screen of my Dell Inspiron 9300."}, {"title": "Easy Notebook Cam", "review_text": "This notebook cam is absolutely easy to setup and use.

The kids and I could see and hear her clearly.  The only draw back I think for all these notebook cams is the way they mount to the laptop, they have a tendency to slip off easily if the edge of the laptop is rounded over as her is.  My compaq presario is more of a square edge and does not preset an issue.  The camera even has face tracking software to keep the persons face in the shot.."}, {"title": "Logitechs Best Product", "review_text": "This a cool product from Logitech.

I've tried several different types of paper and this Canon Photo Paper Plus (I use the glossy finish) produces the best results I've ever gotten. It is impossible for me to tell the difference between the ones I print at home and lab-produced prints. I think it is certainly worth the price Amazon is currently charging. This paper beats out Kodak Picture Paper for quality, as well as the HP papers I've tried,even better than Jet Print Professional papers I've used. Of course, I love the Canon printer too, so it's a great combination.

The reader does not have any kind of spring-loaded memory stick eject, or any eject button.  You just have to pull the card out with your fingers.  When a memory stick pro is fully inserted into the reader, the plastic edges of the reader are wider and longer than the card.  Therefore, it is nearly impossible to grab onto the memory card - even with my tiny fingers.  For someone who intends to use the reader with a card more-or-less permanently installed - it should be fine.  The reader will close shut safely around the card.  However, if you will need to insert and remove cards frequently, I DO NOT recommend this device.  In my case, this physical design flaw makes the reader useless to me.  I should note that although the plastic case design feels flimsy, it does open and close easily.I gave it 2 stars because it DOES actually work for transferring data, and will suit the needs of SOME users."}, {"title": "Great performance, mediocre design", "review_text": "I got this media reader for $15, since I had a couple of 1GB SD cards for my digital camera, and I figured it'd be worth it to check it out for that amount, rather than spending $70-80 on a 1GB USB flash drive.The media reader has a slide-and-flip-top compartment where you insert your Memory Stick/Pro, SD, xD, or MMC cards.  It obviously has to be large enough to accomodate the largest of the aforementioned cards--if it were for only SD cards, they could've easily shortened the length by 25%.On my Win2K system, the reader (with a SD card in it) got detected right away as a removable drive, without any user intervention or driver installation.  With a basic SanDisk (blue) 1GB SD card, via USB2.0 port, I was able to achieve a download throughput of 6.5-7.5MB per second.  In every other respect, it works just like any other USB flash drive.The physical size of the reader is about twice as wide AND thick as a SanDisk Cruzer drive.  Or as thick as a Zippo lighter and twice as wide.  You get the idea.  There is no keyring hole built into the shell, nor does it provide for carrying strap like the Cruzers.  You simply just pocket it and go.  The plastic used for the shell feels brittle and flimsy and door mechanism for the memory cards feels less than sturdy (metal pins under plastic hinges).For $15, I think this is a great gadget, especially if you have a number of memory cards that are not required in your digital cameras all day long.  What would've made it even better (5 stars), in my humble opinion, is some sort of provision to carry it around your neck or attached to the keyring.  A minor detraction, to be sure: The reader part of it works flawlessly as advertised.Update 2005-06-21: After three weeks of light use (used once daily), the plastic cap that protects the USB connector on the reader is already failing to stay on.  This reinforces my perception that while the actual reader itself works excellently, the physical design leaves much to be desired"}, {"title": "No tech support", "review_text": "I bought an GM270 and the Iguidance software based on the first review posted here, and the dang thing is only good for skipping on the water.Holux is a sham, they do NOT provide ANY support for the piece of junk they sell.Once inserted in the dell x51v adn installed their GPSviewer software, (which is their testing/demo program) all I get is that GPSviewer.exe fails to open half the com ports, and the device is NOT on any of the ones it CAN open.

My tablet PC happens to have a compact flash card slot so i didn't need a PCMCIA adapter. I ended up buying a PCMCIA adapter anyways to use it in other peoples laptops, and it works fine with that as well. The GPS unit works with windows 2000, I downloaded the latest drivers from the website as well. At first I was a little worried when I used the GPSViewer software that came with the GPS, as the software would crash... I called tech support, after emailing the support email that gave me the number, which informed me tht you NEED GPS mapping software. So I bought Deloreme 2005 and its great. 110 bucks total and I have GPS and software on my tablet/laptop PC.
